We describe the underlying technical contributions: efficient and localised Near Field Communication (NFC) over a large surface area; object tracking combining NFC signal strength and capacitive footprint detection, and manufacturing techniques for a rollable device form-factor that enables portability, while providing a sizable interaction area when unrolled. In addition, we detail design patterns for tangibles of varying complexity and interactive capabilities, including the ability to sense orientation on the mat, harvest power, provide additional input and output, stack, or extend sensing outside the bounds of the mat. Capabilities and interaction modalities are illustrated with self-generated applications. Finally, we report on the experience of professional game developers building novel physical/digital experiences using the platform.},

@inproceedings{marshall:2017a,
	abstract = {HCI often requires scholars to build upon research from fields outside their expertise, creating the risk that foundational work is misunderstood and misrepresented. The prevailing goal of "exergames" research towards ameliorating obesity appears to be built on just such a misunderstanding of health research. In this paper, we analyse all citations to a single influential study, which has been extensively cited to justify research on exergames. We categorise the 375 citations based on whether they represent the findings of that study accurately or inaccurately. Our findings suggest that 69% of exergames papers citing this study misrepresent the findings, demonstrating a systematic failure of scholarship in exergames research. We argue that exergaming research should cease focusing on games as treatment for obesity, and that HCI publications should demand more critical and scholarly engagement with research from outside HCI.},

@article{vosoughi:2018a,
	abstract = {There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by \~{}3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.Science, this issue p. 1146We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the effect of visually-anchored prediction accuracy of haptic information on the perceived presence of virtual environments. We designed an experiment which explicitly prevented confounding factors potentially introduced by virtual body ownership and/or agency. The experimental design consisted of two main conditions defining congruent vs incongruent visual and haptic cues. Presence was measured during as well as after exposure. A distance estimation task solely based on motor action and the visually-anchored spatial model of the environment was executed to control for perceptual binding. 56 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups in a single-blind mixed-group design study. The study revealed increased presence for high prediction accuracy and decreased  presence for low prediction accuracy, while perceptual binding still occurred. The observed effect sizes were in the medium range. The results indicate a significant correlation between prediction accuracy of haptic information and the perceived realness and presence of a virtual environment which gives rise to a discussion about models for dissociative symptom derealisation.},

@article{zaidi:2007aa,
	abstract = {As the ear has dual functions for audition and balance, the eye has a dual role in detecting light for a wide range of behavioral and physiological functions separate from sight. These responses are driven primarily by stimulation of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that are most sensitive to short-wavelength ( approximately 480 nm) blue light and remain functional in the absence of rods and cones. We examined the spectral sensitivity of non-image-forming responses in two profoundly blind subjects lacking functional rods and cones (one male, 56 yr old; one female, 87 yr old). In the male subject, we found that short-wavelength light preferentially suppressed melatonin, reset the circadian pacemaker, and directly enhanced alertness compared to 555 nm exposure, which is the peak sensitivity of the photopic visual system. In an action spectrum for pupillary constriction, the female subject exhibited a peak spectral sensitivity (lambda(max)) of 480 nm, matching that of the pRGCs but not that of the rods and cones. This subject was also able to correctly report a threshold short-wavelength stimulus ( approximately 480 nm) but not other wavelengths. Collectively these data show that pRGCs contribute to both circadian physiology and rudimentary visual awareness in humans and challenge the assumption that rod- and cone-based photoreception mediate all "visual" responses to light.},

	abstract = {In real life, people engage in interactive decision processes by consulting with experts. However, before taking advice, they must recognise the authority of an expert to assess the quality of the advice. The main goal of this research was to investigate how the confirmation effect affects lay evaluations of the epistemic authority of financial experts. Experiment 1 showed that lay people tend to ascribe greater epistemic authority to those experts whose advice confirms peoples opinions, both measured and manipulated. Experiment 2 revealed that when participants own opinions are not salient, people tend to evaluate experts authority as higher when their advice confirms social norms. In Experiment 3 we jointly investigated the effects of participants own opinions and social norms on the evaluations of authority. When both sources of expertise were made salient, decision-makers favoured advice confirming their own beliefs and used it to evaluate experts authority. Three interpretations of the role confirmation plays in the experts authority evaluations are proposed: (1) self-defensive strategies; (2) processing fluency; and (3) psychological consequences of na€ıve realism. The paper discusses practical implications of the results. We propose that increasing consumers knowledge about biases might protect their evaluations of financial advice from being susceptible to the confirmation effect.},

@article{zendle:2018b,
	abstract = {Abstract A common argument in the violent video game (VVG) literature is that the greater the realism of a game, the more it activates aggressive concepts, and the greater antisocial effects it will have on its players. Several experiments have therefore looked into whether the graphical realism of VVGs might influence their effects. These experiments have returned mixed results. However, there are other ways that a VVG can be realistic besides looking like the real world. More specifically, things in VVGs can not only look realistic, they can also behave realistically. It may be the case that this kind of realism leads to increases in the activation of aggressive concepts, rather than increases in graphical realism. In this paper, we therefore present two large-scale online experiments (n = 898 and n = 1880) which investigate the effects of two different manipulations of behavioural realism on the activation of aggressive concepts in VVGs. In neither experiment did increasing realism increase the activation of aggressive concepts. Realism is often described as increasing the effects of VVGs. These results contradict this perspective, and instead suggest that realism may not lead to increases in aggression-related variables.},

@article{zendle:2018a,
	abstract = {Abstract Video games depict a variety of different concepts. Models of learning in games like the GLM (General Learning Model) and GAM (General Aggression Model) predict that exposing players to these in-game concepts can lead to important changes in player behaviour. Priming effects are thought to be key to determining these changes in behaviour. However, recent research has suggested problems with the priming effects that have previously been observed in the video game literature. Indeed, widespread methodological issues with this body of research make it unclear whether priming effects occur at all in video games. Two experiments (total N = 532) investigated whether priming effects still occurred in video games when known confounds in the literature were accounted for. Priming was observed in neither study. However, in both studies a novel negative priming effect was observed instead, in which exposure to a specific concept inhibited players' reactions to things that were related to that concept. These studies support previous research which indicates there may be serious confounding in the video game literature. They also suggest that the priming-related effects of video games may be overestimated. Finally, they highlight the potential existence of negative priming as an effect of video game play.},

Sunburst (mehr als 1000 Beitr{\"a}ge seit 12.01.03)
Das ich jetzt mehr und mehr M{\"u}nzen in ein dudelndes Ger{\"a}t schmeisse,
konnte ich noch nicht feststellen, wenngleich ich sicherlich fast
genausoviel f{\"u}r die Computerspiele ausgebe, sehe ich keine affinit{\"a}t
zu riskanteren Verhaltensmustern, und {\"u}berhaupt ...

Alleine die Beweislegung das wer auch Illegales tut jederzeit ein
Computerspieler ist, ist ansich schon ein Affron, an alle die die
ihre Zeit damit verbringen, was will uns der Autor damit sagen,
bewaffnet euch oder was bitte?

Grundsteinlegung von b{\"o}sem Verhalten indem man Kriminelle mit
Zeitverschleuderern gleichsetzt, das ist einfach abartig.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
--------

Aber kommen wir doch mal zur Sichtweise der Generationen:
Denn das Problem das die Jugend gern anders tut als die {\"a}ltere
Genaration ist so alt wie die Menschheit.

----------
(Keilschrifttext aus Ur um 2000 v. Chr.)
"Unsere Jugend ist heruntergekommen und zuchtlos.
Die jungen Leute h{\"o}ren nicht mehr auf ihre Eltern.
Das Ende der Welt ist nahe."

-------

(Aristoteles um 400 v. Chr.)
"Ich habe {\"u}berhaupt keine Hoffnung mehr in die Zukunft unseres
Landes,
wenn einmal unsere Jugend die M{\"a}nner von morgen stellt.
Unsere Jugend ist unertr{\"a}glich, unverantwortlich und entsetzlich
anzusehen."

--------

Sokrates (470 - 399 v. Chr.)
"Die Jugend liebt heutzutage den Luxus. 
Sie hat schlechte Manieren, verachtet die Autorit{\"a}t, hat keinen
Respekt vor 
{\"a}lteren Leuten und schwatzt, wo sie arbeiten soll. 
Die jungen Leute stehen nicht mehr auf, wenn {\"A}ltere das Zimmer
betreten. 
Sie widersprechen ihren Eltern, schwadronieren in der Gesellschaft,
verschlingen bei Tisch die 
S{\"u}{\ss}speisen, legen die Beine {\"u}bereinander und tyrannisieren ihre
Lehrer." 

--------

Platon (427 - 347v.Chr.) »Der Staat«
» ...die Sch{\"u}ler achten Lehrer und Erzieher gering. {\"U}berhaupt, die
J{\"u}ngeren stellen sich den {\"A}lteren gleich und treten gegen sie 
auf, in Wort und Tat.« 

--------

580 n.Chr. schreibt Gregor von TOURS, 
»...da{\ss} man die Flammen der jugendlichen Leidenschaft nur mit Hilfe
der 
kl{\"o}sterlichen Aufsicht und einer strengen Disziplin besiegen k{\"o}nne.« 

---------

1250 vertritt Vincent von BEAUVAIS die Auffassung, 
»...wenn der Knabe ... ins J{\"u}nglingsalter tritt, so hat er auch dann,
weil sich dieses Alter ebenso leicht dem B{\"o}sen 
zuneigt, den Z{\"u}gel der Zucht n{\"o}tig...«

---------

M{\"o}nch Peter, 1274
»Die Welt macht schlimme Zeiten durch. 
Die jungen Leute von heute denken an nichts anderes als an sich
selbst. 
Sie haben keine Ehrfurcht vor ihren Eltern oder dem Alter. Sie sind
ungeduldig 
und unbeherrscht. Sie reden so, als w{\"u}ssten sie alles, und was wir
f{\"u}r weise halten, empfinden sie als Torheit.
Und was die M{\"a}dchen betrifft, sie sind unbescheiden und unweiblich in
ihrer Ausdrucksweise, ihrem Benehmen 
und ihrer Kleidung.« 

-----------

(18. Jahrhundert)
»Das Sittenverderben unserer heutigen Jugend ist so gro{\ss}, dass ich 
unm{\"o}glich l{\"a}nger bei derselben aushalten kann. Ja, oft geschieht es,
dass die nicht in Schranken 
gehaltene oder nicht geb{\"u}hrend ausgetriebene Zuchtlosigkeit eines
einzigen J{\"u}nglings von ungesunder Triebkraft 
und verdorbenen Ausw{\"u}chsen auch die {\"u}brigen noch frischen und
gesunden Pflanzen ansteckt.« 

-----------

1852 heisst es in einem Regierungsbericht: 
»Es ist die Wahrnehmung gemacht worden, da{\ss} bei der Schuljugend die 
fr{\"u}her kundgegebene Anst{\"a}ndigkeit und das sittliche Benehmen ... mehr
und mehr verschwinde.«

-----------------
-----------------

Es war es ist und es wird auch immer so bleiben, 
auch wenn man Jugentliche in eine schublade stecken will
wird es immer eine andere sein als die in die man selbst gesteckt
wurde zu seiner eigenen Jungend und letztendlich war der Inhalt immer
der gleiche,
auch ist die Intolleranz der {\"A}lteren gegen{\"u}ber den Jugentlichen
gleich geblieben, und das l{\"a}sst sich mit Studen trefflich
untermauern...

	abstract = {In this work we present a generic architecture for interfacing various input devices to VRML browsers. Concentrating on the aspect of navigation, our system supports the full range of potential input devices from conventional haptic devices like keyboard and mouse over special Virtual-Reality devices like spacemouse and joystick to, as a special feature, semantically higher level input like speech and gesture recognition. The communication between the individual components of the system is based on a context free grammar, allowing abstract modeling of the various devices and handling both discrete and continuous navigation information. Two new node extensions support the VRML author in creating highly customizable 3D applications: The DeviceSensor node allows grabbing arbitrary user input in a systematic way and the Camera node gives full control over the scene view by specifying velocity vectors and thus enabling arbitrary navigation modes. Finally, the proof of concept is given by a prototypical implementation in VRML.},

Simple lexical entries are added to an application-specific datr lexicon which inherits morphosyntactic, syntactic, and lexico-semantic constraints from an applicationindependent set of structured base definitions. A lexicon generator expands the datr lexicon out into a disjunctive normal form lexicon. This is then encoded either as an acceptance lexicon (in which the constraining features are bit-encoded for use in pruning word lattices), or as a full lexicon (which is used for assigning interpretations, or for generating messages).

As with previous editions, students learn to program three-dimensional applications as soon as possible--low level algorithms (for topics such as line drawing and fill polygons) are presented after students are creating graphics. The Fourth edition focuses on core theory in graphics. All topics required for a fundamental course, such as light-material interactions, shading, modeling, curves and surfaces, antialiasing, texture mapping, and compositing and hardware issues are covered.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development of the programming language Erlang during the period 1985-1997. Erlang is a concurrent programming language designed for programming large-scale distributed soft real-time control applications. The design of Erlang was heavily influenced by ideas from the logic and functional programming communities. Other sources of inspiration came from languages such as Chill and Ada which are used in industry for programming control systems. 1 Introduction This paper describes the development of the Erlang programming language. Erlang is a language which draws heavily from various traditions in the logic, functional and realtime control programming communities. Our goal was to make a language which could be used for building large soft real-time control systems. By large I mean systems with possibly millions of lines of code. By a soft real-time system I mean a system which does not fail catastrophically if a real-time deadline is missed. Erlang was developed ...},

The paper reviews the intersection of AI and VEs. It considers the use of AI as a component of a VE and Intelligent Virtual Agents as a major application area, covering movement, sensing, behaviour and control architectures. It surveys work on emotion and natural language interaction, and considers interactive narrative as a case-study. It concludes by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current state-of-the-art and what might take it forward.},

	abstract = {Reearch into virtual environments on the one hand and artificial intelligence and artificial life on the other has largely been carried out by two different groups of people with different preoccu- pations and interests, but some convergence is now apparent between the two fields. Applications in which activity independent of the user takes place --- involving crowds or other agents --- are beginning to be tackled, while synthetic agents, virtual humans and computer pets are all areas in which techniqes from the two fields require strong integration. The two communities have much to learn from each other if wheels are not to be reinvented on both sides. This paper reviews the issues arising from combining artificial intelligence and artificial life techniques with those of virtual environments to produce just such intelligent virtual environments. The discussion is illustrated with examples that include environments providing knowledge to direct or assist the user rather than relying entirely on the user's knowledge and skills, those in which the user is represented by a partially autonomous avatar, those containing intelligent agents separate from the user, and many others from both sides of the area.},

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	abstract = {An illusory sensation of ownership over a surrogate limb or whole body can be induced through specific forms of multisensory stimulation, such as synchronous visuotactile tapping on the hidden real and visible rubber hand in the rubber hand illusion. Such methods have been used to induce ownership over a manikin and a virtual body that substitute the real body, as seen from first-person perspective, through a head-mounted display. However, the perceptual and behavioral consequences of such transformed body ownership have hardly been explored. In Exp. 1, immersive virtual reality was used to embody 30 adults as a 4-y-old child (condition C), and as an adult body scaled to the same height as the child (condition A), experienced from the first-person perspective, and with virtual and real body movements synchronized. The result was a strong body-ownership illusion equally for C and A. Moreover there was an overestimation of the sizes of objects compared with a nonembodied baseline, which was significantly greater for C compared with A. An implicit association test showed that C resulted in significantly faster reaction times for the classification of self with child-like compared with adult-like attributes. Exp. 2 with an additional 16 participants extinguished the ownership illusion by using visuomotor asynchrony, with all else equal. The size-estimation and implicit association test differences between C and A were also extinguished. We conclude that there are perceptual and probably behavioral correlates of body-ownership illusions that occur as a function of the type of body in which embodiment occurs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient and robust technique for generating global motion paths for a human model in virtual environments. Initially, a scene is discretized using raster hardware to generate an environment map. An obstacle-free cell path sub-optimal according to Manhattan metric is generated between any two cells. Unlike 2D techniques present in literature, the proposed algorithm works for complex 3D environments suitable for video games and architectural walk-throughs. For obstacle avoidance, the algorithm considers both physical dimensions of the human and actions such as jumping, bending, etc. Path smoothening is carried out to keep the cell path as closely as possible to Euclidean straight-line paths.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

@article{barsalou:1999,
	abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statis- tics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement record- ing systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The stor- age and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components -- not at the level of holistic perceptual expe- riences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a com- mon frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspec- tion (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and ab- stract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinato- rially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a per- ceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal sym- bol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

- Positive Effekte von Games
- Gamification

Zitiert in SZ Nr. 51 v. 1.3.2013:
Neurowissenschaftler Bavelier (Rochester, Genf) und Davidson (Uni Wisconsin):
"Es gen{\"u}ge nicht, wenn Forscher immer nur erkunden. was Computerspiele in jugendlichen Gehirnen schlimmes anrichten, sie sollten helfen, {\"u}berzeugende Computerspiele zu entwickeln, die die Hirnfunktionen verbessern und das Wohlbefinden f{\"o}rdern."

Schon die Zahlen spr{\"a}chen daf{\"u}r: Allein im Monat nach dem Start von CoD Blacks Ops 68000 Mannjahre investiert von Gamern.

"Das Spiel wird uns bleiben,{\ldots}, wir m{\"u}ssen/sollen die solche Bahnen lenken, dass sich positive Effekte f{\"u}r Gehirn und Verhalten ergeben."

Verweis auf Studie, in welcher die visuellen F{\"a}higkeiten in FPS gesteigert werden. Jugendliche mit ca 1h/Tag bei 5Tagen/Woche {\"u}ber 8-10 Wochem besseres Detaildetektion und Graustufenaufl{\"o}sung.

Nach Verfolgungdjsgd in Labyrinth bessere mentale 3D Rotation.

Effekte noch nach 6 Monaten nachweisbar. 

Es h{\"a}ufen sich Berichte {\"u}ber positive Effekte res{\"u}mieren die Autoren: Im Spiel "Sparx" k{\"o}nnen depressive Jugendliche in einer Phantasiewelt gegen schwarze Gedanken k{\"a}mpfen, In "Re-Mission" sprenge junge Krebspatienten virtuelle Tumorzellen in die Luft und beseitigen Nebenwirkungen.

Der durch seine Meditationsforshung bekannte Richard Davidson: Wenn das meditative Training des Gehirns, wie man heute wi{\ss}, das plastische Gehirn ver{\"a}ndern kann, wiiso sollte das nicht auch durch das aktive Training am Computer m{\"o}glich sein?

Verweis auf Studie von Greitmeyer und Osswald (Lemmings)

Folgerung:
Wenn bereits normale Spiele solche Effekte aufweisen, was ist dann mit denkbar wenn mit wissenschafticher Expertise und Methode gezielt Spiele f{\"u}r bestimmte Ziele designed?

Spieledesigner und Neurowissenschaftler sollte gezielt zusammenarbeiten, um unterschiedliche Auswirkungen zu erforschen, {\"a}hnlich der Medikamentenforschung. Scheu verlieren. Aber auch Nebenwirkungen icht vernachl{\"a}ssigen: gesteigerte Agressivit{\"a}t (woher? Beleg?), Aufmerksamkeitsst{\"o}rungen (Beleg?), vernichtete Lebenszeit (subjektiv)

	abstract = {People's fear and anxiety about doing math--over and above actual math ability--can be an impediment to their math achievement. We show that when the math-anxious individuals are female elementary school teachers, their math anxiety carries negative consequences for the math achievement of their female students. Early elementary school teachers in the United States are almost exclusively female (>90\%), and we provide evidence that these female teachers' anxieties relate to girls' math achievement via girls' beliefs about who is good at math. First- and second-grade female teachers completed measures of math anxiety. The math achievement of the students in these teachers' classrooms was also assessed. There was no relation between a teacher's math anxiety and her students' math achievement at the beginning of the school year. By the school year's end, however, the more anxious teachers were about math, the more likely girls (but not boys) were to endorse the commonly held stereotype that "boys are good at math, and girls are good at reading" and the lower these girls' math achievement. Indeed, by the end of the school year, girls who endorsed this stereotype had significantly worse math achievement than girls who did not and than boys overall. In early elementary school, where the teachers are almost all female, teachers' math anxiety carries consequences for girls' math achievement by influencing girls' beliefs about who is good at math.},

The model aims to provide flexible and natural support for managing conversations among large groups gathered in virtual space. However, it can also be used to control more general interactions among other kinds of objects inhabiting such spaces. The model defines the key abstractions of object aura, nimbus, focus and adapters to control mutual levels of awareness. Furthermore, these are defined in a sufficiently general way so as to apply to any CSCW system where a spatial metric can be identified - i.e. a way of measuring position and direction. Several examples are discussed, including virtual reality and text conferencing applications. Finally, the paper provides a more formal computational architecture for the spatial model by relating it to the object oriented modelling approach for distributed systems.},

The framework is realised as an extension to our previous spatial model of interaction and aims to provide greater scaleability and flexibility for communication between the inhabitants of virtual worlds. Our framework introduces an explicit crowd mechanism into CVEs in order to support the formation and activation of different kinds of crowd with different effects on mutual awareness and communication (achieved through the use of aggregation techniques combined with awareness adaptation). We present a demonstration application called the Arena - a shared space for staging on-line performances in front of a live audience.},

@article{bers:1996,
	abstract = {This paper presents a body model server (BMS) that provides real-time access to the position and posture of a person's torso, arms, hands, head, and eyes. The BMS functions as a data-layer between the sensing devices and client applications that require real-time human motion data, such as animation control and multi-modal interfaces. By maintaining an abstract representation of the user's body within the system we remove device dependency from the client interface. For data collection, the model uses four magnetic position/orientation sensors, two data-gloves, and an eye-tracker. The BMS combines the data-streams from the sensors and transforms them into snap-shots of the user's upper-body pose. A geometric model made up of joints and segments structures the input. Posture of the body is represented by joint angles. Two unique characteristics of our approach are: the use of the implicit, geometric constraints of the sensed body to simplify the computation of the unmeasured joint angles, and the use of time-stamped data that allows synchronization with other data streams, e.g. speech input. The working server provides clients with accurate information at up to 40 Hz over a local area network. This paper describes the architecture of the BMS, including the management of multiple input devices, the representation and computation of the position and joint angle data, and the client-server interface.},

	abstract = {This article describes the canvas portal framework that facilitates the development of alternative view-based space-management techniques on large displays. Implementations of the framework provide layout management, context switching, and space creation. The canvas portals are alternative views of display canvas areas where interacting with the portal's interior is equivalent to interacting with the depicted display area. To illustrate the generality of the canvas portals concept, we've instantiated a representative sample of existing large-display interaction techniques within the canvas portal design space, and developed several interaction techniques that address some of the challenges in new ways.},

However, one of the impediments to the widespread use of these technologies is the extensive technical expertise required of application developers. A software environment that provides abstractions from specific details of hardware configurations and low-level software tools is needed to provide a common base for the prototyping, development, testing and debugging of applications. This paper describes VR Juggler, a virtual platform for the creation and execution of immersive applications, that provides a virtual reality system-independent operating environment.

The representation reflects semantic information about dynamic constraints to define objects' modification and construction behavior as well as knowledge structures supporting multimodal interaction utilizing speech and gesture. It is conveniently defined using XML-based markup for virtual building parts. The semantic information is processed during runtime in two ways: Constraint graphs are mapped to a generalized data-flow network and scene-graph. Interaction knowledge is accessed and matched during multimodal analysis.},

Particularly, we concentrate on two aspects. First, a knowledge-based approach for assembling CAD-based parts in VR is introduced. This includes a system to generate meta-information from geometric models

 as well as accompanying task-level algorithms for virtual assembly. Second, a framework for modeling multimodal interaction using gesture and speech is presented that facilitates its generic adaptation to
 scene-graph-based applications. The chosen decomposition of the required core modules is exemplified by an example of a typical object rotation interaction.},

@article{307730,
	abstract = {A person stands in front of a large projection screen on which is shown a checked floor. They say, "Make a table," and a wooden table appears in the middle of the floor."On the table, place a vase," they gesture using a fist relative to palm of their other hand to show the relative location of the vase on the table. A vase appears at the correct location."Next to the table place a chair." A chair appears to the right of the table."Rotate it like this," while rotating their hand causes the chair to turn towards the table."View the scene from this direction," they say while pointing one hand towards the palm of the other. The scene rotates to match their hand orientation.In a matter of moments, a simple scene has been created using natural speech and gesture. The interface of the future? Not at all; Koons, Thorisson and Bolt demonstrated this work in 1992 [23]. Although research such as this has shown the value of combining speech and gesture at the interface, most computer graphics are still being developed with tools no more intuitive than a mouse and keyboard. This need not be the case. Current speech and gesture technologies make multimodal interfaces with combined voice and gesture input easily achievable. There are several commercial versions of continuous dictation software currently available, while tablets and pens are widely supported in graphics applications. However, having this capability doesn't mean that voice and gesture should be added to every modeling package in a haphazard manner. There are numerous issues that must be addressed in order to develop an intuitive interface that uses the strengths of both input modalities.In this article we describe motivations for adding voice and gesture to graphical applications, review previous work showing different ways these modalities may be used and outline some general interface guidelines. Finally, we give an overview of promising areas for future research. Our motivation for writing this is to spur developers to build compelling interfaces that will make speech and gesture as common on the desktop as the keyboard and mouse.},

	abstract = {Background: Use of virtual reality tool is interesting for the evaluation of Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to administer controlled task like the typical neuropsychological tools, but in an environment much more like standard classroom. Previous studies showed that a virtual classroom was able to distinguish performances of children with and without ADHD, but the evolution of performances over time has not been explored. The aim of this work was to study time on task effects on performances of ADHD children compared to controls in a virtual classroom (VC). Methods: 36 boys aged from 7 to 10 years completed the virtual classroom task. We compared the performance of the children diagnosed with ADHD with those of the control children. We also compared attentional performances recorded in the virtual classroom with measures of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT II). Results: Our results showed that patients differ from control subjects in term of time effect on performances. If controls sustained performances over time in the virtual reality task, ADHD patients showed a significant performance decrement over time. Performances at the VC correlated with CPT II measures. Conclusion: ADHD children are vulnerable to a time on task effect on performances which could explain part of their difficulties. Virtual reality is a reliable method to test ADHD children ability to sustain performances over time.},

The simpler models used in the past are being augmented by more complex models gleaned from the physics literature. This paper is another step in the direction of assimilating such knowledge. It concerns the statistical simulation of light passing through and being reflected by clouds of similar small particles. (It does not, however, address the cloud structure modeling problem). By extension it can be applied to surfaces completely covered by dust and is therefore a physical basis for various theories of diffuse reflection.},

	abstract = { Computer generated shaded images have reached an impressive degree of realism with the current state of the art. They are not so realistic, however, that they would fool many people into believing they are real. One problem is that the surfaces tend to look artificial due to their extreme smoothness. What is needed is a means of simulating the surface irregularities that are on real surfaces. In 1973 Ed Catmull introduced the idea of using the parameter values of parametrically defined surfaces to index into a texture definition function which scales the intensity of the reflected light. By tying the texture pattern to the parameter values, the texture is guaranteed to rotate and move with the object. This is good for showing patterns painted on the surface, but attempts to simulate rough surfaces in this way are unconvincing. This paper presents a method of using a texturing function to perform a small perturbation on the direction of the surface normal before using it in the intensity calculations. This process yields images with realistic looking surface wrinkles without the need to model each wrinkle as a separate surface element. Several samples of images made with this technique are included.},

	abstract = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included. },

	abstract = {Clipping is the process of determining how much of a given line segment lies within the boundaries of the display screen. Homogeneous coordinates are a convenient mathematical device for representing and transforming objects. The space represented by homogeneous coordinates is not, however, a simple Euclidean 3-space. It is, in fact, analagous to a topological shape called a ``projective plane''. The clipping problem is usually solved without consideration for the differences between Euclidean space and the space represented by homogeneous coordinates. For some constructions, this leads to errors in picture generation which show up as lines marked invisible when they should be visible. This paper will examine these cases and present techniques for correctly clipping the line segments.},

	abstract = {In 1974 Ed Catmull developed a new algorithm for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models.The parametrization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The parametric values within each picture element are input to a pattern definition function. A weighted average of the values of this function over the picture element scales the intensity of that picture element. By suitably defining the pattern function, various surfaces textures can be simulated. The shape and size of this weighting function is chosen using digital signal processing theory.The other problem addressed here concerns lighting models. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface. },

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

@inproceedings{burdea:2001a,
	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

Few have been designed with an architecture that allows large numbers of entities from disparate organizations to interact in such a world, in real time, and over large geographic distances. A system architecture that does this is described. The key technologies that have made these virtual worlds possible are discussed, and it is explained and how the technologies fit into the architecture. A sample implementation of this architecture, the SIMulation NETworking (SIMNET) system, is then presented, along with various design decisions and the reasoning behind them},

Three main aspects are addressed: 1) the ability to allow therapists to create new exercises and therapy programs intuitively by direct demonstration, 2) automatic therapy delivery and monitoring with the use of an autonomous virtual tutor that can monitor and quantitatively assess the motions performed by the patient, and 3) networked collaborative remote therapy sessions via connected applications displaying the motions of both the therapist and the patient. We also provide 3D assessment tools for monitoring changes in the range of motion, and for allowing the visualization of a number of properties during or after the execution of exercises. The presented system has been implemented for a low-cost hardware solution based on Kinect and for a high-end immersive virtual reality facility.},

	abstract = {The generation of computer-shaded pictures requires that a program calculate intensities for each pixel. These intensities are then viewed on a monitor or transferred to film. It is desirable that the intensity values on the monitor or the reflectance values on the film have a linear relationship with the original calculated intensities both to give the user fine control over the appearance of the object and to do anti-aliasing properly. However, after the calculated intensity values are sent to the DAC'c some nonlinear distortions occur both in the CRT and on film. We can compensate for this by adjusting the intensity number just before digital-to-analog conversion. This compensation can be accomplished by a table lookup using the intensity as an index into the table and the corresponding value as the new intensity. Fortunately, most hardware manufacturers have made table lookup features part of their equipment. However, the entries in the table must still be generated. The methods for doing this are not well known in the computer graphics community. This paper presents an algorithm for generating a compensation table.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss technical issues in the implementation of Intelligent Virtual Environments (IVE), taking as a starting point their requirement for a specific Knowledge Representation layer. As IVE should combine both an abstract level of representation and a concrete model of some physical world, with which the user can directly interact, there is a need for unifying principles that can describe the relations between the user, the Knowledge Representation layer and the Virtual World. We suggest that, while the user can still interact physically with the Virtual Environment, he can also exchange abstract information with the underlying Knowledge Representation layer through Natural Language, and that this information should be interpreted into corresponding state of affairs in the Virtual Environment. Conversely, there is also a need for describing the Virtual World dynamics in terms of the high-level concepts that populate the Knowledge Representation layer. After illustrating these issues in the context of &quot;Brightown &quot; scenarios, we discuss the use of some Artificial Intelligence techniques and formalisms in the specific context of Intelligent Virtual Environments and outline a framework for their implementation. 1.},
	annote = {Marc Cavazza: High-Level Interpretation in Dynamic Virtual Environments

 Vom 4.2.2004 1. Introduction In intelligenten Virtual Environments (IVE) werden Repr{\"a}sentationen notwendig: - um abstraktes Wissen ({\"u}ber Konzepte) - konkretes Wissen {\"u}ber existierende (zu visualisierende) Objekte darzustellen umgesetzt durch ein knowledge represyenation layer. Verbindungen zwischen den high-level Konzepten und Instanzen sind auch Transformationen auf den Objekten, aus direkter Manipulation entstehend oder durch allgemeine wissensbasierte Prozesse angestosen. In IVE die aktuelle Situation ist assoziiert mit einem abstrakten description level f{\"u}r die Umgebung und dargestellt in der virtuellen Umgebung. Notwendig ist der Zugriff zu konkreten (direkt an die visuelle Darstellung gebunden) und abstrakten Informationen (ben{\"o}tigt zum Verst{\"a}ndnis von an den Kontext-gebundenen Anweisungen, die die Szene ver{\"a}ndern). H{\"a}ufig wurde in VE bisher nach einem command paradigm interagiert: Direkte Anweisungen an einzelne Objekte werden umgesetzt. Demgegen{\"u}ber steht ein interpretation paradigm, in dem Informationen allgemein ge{\"a}usert werden ({\"u}ber Sprache) und {\"u}ber dem aktuellen Kontext und dem Hintergrundwissen in Anderungen oder Beschreibungen umgesetzt werden. 2. "Brightown" Scenarios f{\"u}r high-level interpretation Bsp.szenario ist die Simulation einer virtuellen Stadt: Obj. Pers diese k{\"o}nnen jeweils ein eigenes Verhalten aufweisen und Aktionen zur Verf{\"u}gung stellen. Der User tritt {\"u}ber nat{\"u}rliche Sprache (NL) mit der Umgebung in Interaktion oder {\"u}ber direkte Manipulation. NL kann dabei auch abstrakte Information vermitteln oder umfassendere Anweisungen enthalten. In der Umgebung gelten spezielle Regeln: {\"u}ber Aussehen und Verhalten von Dingen A. Einhalten der Regeln wird {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft ({\"u}ber User Aktionen) > umsetzen der primitiven Aktionen in high-level repr. > Plan => Inferenz anstosen B. Abstrakte Anweisungen und Informationen umsetzen in VE: Zustand der Umgebung wird inkrementell aus den Anweisungen aufgebaut und im weiteren Verlauf darauf als Kontext aufbauend ausgewertet (Beschreibung in NL eines Ereignisses => simulieren in VE), 3. Interpretieren der NL descriptions Beziehungen zwischen Knowledeg Representation Layer und VE m{\"u}ssen in fundamentalem Framework beschreibbar sein: VE kann als extensionale Repr. und knowledge layer als intensionale Repr. gesehen werden => {\"u}bertragbar auf Arbeiten im Bereich von Knowledeg Representation (sp{\"a}ter explizit: SN). > Spezielle Beziehungen werden n{\"o}tig Sprachverstehen: Speech recognition > NLP = meist nur konzeptuelle Repr. => erw. Darstellung (basiert auf TAGs): Tree-Furcating Grammar - semantische Integration zur Laufzeit m{\"o}glich Ausgabe aus NLP: Beschreibung der Szene > Interpretieren: Zustands- oder Aktionsbeschreibung Uber 4 Schritte (umgesetzt durch procedural semantics): I. genannte Objekte erzeugen / referenzieren (als Prototyp-Instanzen, erbend) II. Aktionen auf diesen simulieren III. Objektverhalten simulieren IV. User Interaktion umsetzen (! Konflikte zu III.!) Umgesetzt werden die Schritte durch procedural semantics: Prozeduren auf der Repr{\"a}sentation arbeitend sind mit den Auserungen assoziiert, Entgegen der Kritik an procedural semantics (nur semantische Theorie, schwer wartbar und nicht kompositionell) sind diese durchaus gut einsetzbar: gerade in VE als Dom{\"a}ne, da sie dort nicht blos Theorie sondern direkt Implementierung sind. Objektverhalten (phys. Verhalten) soll formalisiert werden durch Umsetzung durch proc. sem. oder Ubertragung auf qualitative Prozesse. 4. Interpreting Virtual World Dynamics N{\"a}chster Schritt w{\"a}re dann auch die dynamischen Anderungen in VE zu interpretieren: Anderungen feststellen > abstrahieren auf high-level Konzepte von Aktionen Ansatz: Uber duale Konzepte = anbieten von qualitativen Simulationen {\"u}ber symbol. Welt Ferner ist das hinzukommen weiterer Modalit{\"a}ten von Bedeutung. Gesten zur direkten Manipulation Sprache weiterhin als Haupttr{\"a}ger von h{\"o}heren und abstrakteren Beschreibungen 5. Conclusion User: kann mit Umgebung direkt interagieren oder aber durch NL, auch abstraktere Anweisungen oder Zustandsbeschreibungen enthaltend In IVE: Hat NLU F{\"a}higkeit und Scene-Understanding (als Kontext) F{\"a}higkeit. Hypothese: Die application concepts, die die m{\"o}glichen Transformationen in der VE beschreiben, entsprechen in ihrer Struktur g{\"a}ngigen semantischen Strukturen zur Ubertragung aus NL.

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

@article{Chu:1997:MUI,
	annote = {The generation of geometric shapes called "geometric concept designs\& quot; via the multi-sensory user interface of a virtual reality (VR) based system motivates the current research. In this new VR-based system, geometric designs can be more effectively inputted into the computer in a physically intuitive way. The interaction mechanism is similar to the way in which industrial designers sit and discuss concept design shapes across a table from each other, prior to making a final decision about the product details. By using different sensory modalities, such as voice, hand motions and gestures, product designers can convey design ideas through the VR-based computer-aided design (CAD) system. In this scenario, the multi-sensory interface between human and computer plays a central role with respect to usability, usefulness and accuracy. The current paper focuses on determining the requirements for the multi-sensory user interface and assessing the applications of different input and output mechanisms in the virtual environment (VE). In order to evaluate this multi-sensory user interface, this paper formulates the typical activities in product shape design into a set of requirements for the VR-CAD system. On the basis of these requirements, we interviewed typical CAD users about the effectiveness of using different sensory input and output interaction mechanisms such as visual, auditory and tactile. According to the results of these investigations, a nodal network of design activity that defines the multi-sensory user interface of the VR-CAD system is determined in the current research. The VR-CAD system is still being developed. However, voice command input, hand motion input, three-dimensional visual output and auditory output have been successfully integrated into the current system. Moreover, several mechanical parts have been successfully created through the VR interface. Once designers use the VR-CAD system that we are currently developing, the interface requirements determined in the current paper may be verified or refined. The objectives of the current research are to expand the frontiers of product design and establish a new paradigm for the VR-based conceptual shape design system.},

	abstract = {The design and operation of the Virtual Reality Distributed Environment and Construction Kit (VR-DECK) toolkit developed at IBM Research is reviewed. It provides a designer with a development environment while supporting distributed computing, multi-user capability, and a variety of I/O devices. Virtual worlds are built as collections of modules which communicate via events. Extensive run-time support in the form of extensive C++ class libraries insulates the application designer from the low-level system details such as networking, inter-module data transport, event queuing and matching, and I/O device communication. A library of pre-defined modules is provided for commonly used functions and devices. An X Window System graphical user interface is provided for aggregating modules into applications. The system enables a developer to focus on the design of the application rather than on systems and integration issues},

As computer imagery becomes more sophisticated, surfaces have more complex shading characteristics and thus require a less rigid shading model. This paper presents a flexible tree-structured shading model that can represent a wide range of shading characteristics. The model provides an easy means for specifying complex shading characteristics. It is also efficient because it can tailor the shading calculations to each type of surface.},

	abstract = { Ray tracing is one of the most elegant techniques in computer graphics. Many phenomena that are difficult or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing, including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions, however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections. Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in previous methods.},

The first example of this technique, the ``mip'' map, uses a set of tables containing successively lower-resolution representations filtered down from the discrete texture function. An alternative method using a single table of values representing the integral over the texture function rather than the function itself may yield superior results at similar cost. The necessary algorithms to support the new technique are explained. Finally, the cost and performance of the new technique is compared to previous techniques.},

Grundidee ist die Trennung von Szenenspezifikation und Szenenevaluation. Daf{\"u}r werden die Knoten im SG angeordnet und zus{\"a}tzlich mit rendering objects ausgestattet, deren Interpretation durch Engine abh{\"a}ngige und spezifische rendering engines und handler {\"u}bernommen wird. 2.

Multi-Pass Rendering Techniques implementieren multi-pass rendering: Sie definieren daf{\"u}r ein oder mehrere rendering passes und {\"u}bernehmen Kontrolle {\"u}ber die Auswertung der Shapes und Attribute 7.Conclusions Generalisierte Szenengraphen unterscheiden zwischen Struktur und Inhalt der Szenenspezifikation. Die Auswertung des Inhalts wird von rendering engines {\"u}bernommen, die die Interpretation an Handler und Techniques {\"u}bergeben (= Mapping).

@article{dasgupta:2015a,
	abstract = {For years, public discourse in science education, technology, and policy-making has focused on the "leaky pipeline" problem: the observation that fewer women than men enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields and more women than men leave. Less attention has focused on experimentally testing solutions to this problem. We report an experiment investigating one solution: we created "microenvironments" (small groups) in engineering with varying proportions of women to identify which environment increases motivation and participation, and whether outcomes depend on students' academic stage. Female engineering students were randomly assigned to one of three engineering groups of varying sex composition: 75% women, 50% women, or 25% women. For first-years, group composition had a large effect: women in female-majority and sex-parity groups felt less anxious than women in female-minority groups. However, among advanced students, sex composition had no effect on anxiety. Importantly, group composition significantly affected verbal participation, regardless of women's academic seniority: women participated more in female-majority groups than sex-parity or female-minority groups. Additionally, when assigned to female-minority groups, women who harbored implicit masculine stereotypes about engineering reported less confidence and engineering career aspirations. However, in sex-parity and female-majority groups, confidence and career aspirations remained high regardless of implicit stereotypes. These data suggest that creating small groups with high proportions of women in otherwise male-dominated fields is one way to keep women engaged and aspiring toward engineering careers. Although sex parity works sometimes, it is insufficient to boost women's verbal participation in group work, which often affects learning and mastery.},

@article{deligiannidis:2005,
	abstract = {DLoVe (Distributed Links over Variables evaluation) is a new model for specifying and implementing virtual reality and other next-generation or ``non-WIMP'' user interfaces. Our approach matches the parallel and continuous structure of these interfaces by combining a data-flow or constraint-like component with an event- based component for discrete interactions. Moreover, because the underlying constraint graph naturally lends itself to parallel computation, DLoVe provides for the constraint graph to be partitioned and executed in parallel across several machines, for improved performance. With our system, one can write a program designed for a single machine but can execute it in a distributed environment with minor code modifications. The system also supports mechanics for implementing or transforming single user programs into multi-user programs. We present experiments demonstrating how DLoVe improves performance by dramatically increasing the validity of the rendered frames. We also present performance measures to measure statistical skew in the frames, which we believe is more suitable for interactive systems than traditional measures of parallel systems, such as throughput or frame rate, because they fail to capture the freshness of each rendered frame},

	abstract = {ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 describes a potential family of International Standards, named the Common Industry Formats (CIF), that document the specification and evaluation of the usability of interactive systems. It provides a general overview of the CIF framework and contents, definitions, and the relationship of the framework elements. The intended users of the framework are identified, as well as the situations in which the framework may be applied. The assumptions and constraints of the framework are also enumerated.

The framework content includes the following:

consistent terminology and classification of specification, evaluation and reporting;
a definition of the type and scope of formats and the high-level structure to be used for documenting required information and the results of evaluation.
ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 is applicable to software and hardware products used for predefined tasks. The information items are intended to be used as part of system-level documentation resulting from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210, and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 process standards.

ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 focuses on documenting those elements needed for design and development of usable systems, rather than prescribing a specific process. It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International Standards, including ISO 9241, ISO 20282, ISO/IEC 9126 and the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC 25000 to ISO/IEC 25099).

ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 does not prescribe any kind of method, life cycle or process.},

	abstract = {We report about applications of spatial sound reproduction in immersive virtual environments realized with the CyberStage audio-visual display and the sound rendering system designed for it. A survey of the CyberStage Spatial Sound Server's architecture and its hardware and software components is given. The different sound rendering methods employed are discussed in view of the wide range of applications realized with the system. The CyberStage is GMD's CAVE-like audio-visual projection system integrating a 4-side visual stereo display and an 8-channel spatial auditory display. A software-based sound server for the generation of auditory cues for interactive virtual environments has been developed for this display system in the context of a research project on the integrated simulation of image and sound. Five applications from different areas are discussed as representative examples of the sound server's flexibility: a virtual sound installation, an marketing and infotainment application, an augmented museum environment project, a scientific visualization and sonification application, and a sketch of a music composition. In the presentation on the conference these examples are illustrated with a video tape.},

@article{edelman:2011,
	abstract = {By what empirical means can a person determine whether he or she is
presently awake or dreaming? Subjecting the experienced reality to a
statistical test for bizarreness requires a set of baseline
measurements. In a dream or in a simulation, those would be vulnerable
to tampering by the same processes that give rise to the experienced
reality, making the outcome of a reality test impossible to trust.
Moreover, cryptographic defenses against tampering cannot be relied
upon, because of the potentially unlimited reach of reality
modification, which may range from the integrity of the verification
keys to the declared outcome of the entire process.

Although the rational course of action in the face of this double
predicament is to take reality at face value, even the most revealing
insight that a person may gain into the ultimate nature of reality
(for instance, by attaining enlightenment) is ultimately unreliable,
for the reasons just mentioned. However, to adhere to this principle,
one has to be aware of it, which may not be possible in various states
of altered cognitive function (e.g., dreaming). Thus, a subjectively
enlightened person may still lack the one truly important piece of the
puzzle concerning his or her existence.},

	abstract = {The internet, as well as various mobile media (e.g. cellular phones, handhelds, mobile paddles) have proven very useful in supporting psychotherapeutic measures in various projects. Virtual reality technologies (VR) take technical as well as intervention possibilities a step further. They enable the creation of computer-based models of the real world, with which interaction via the human-machine interface is enabled. The three-dimensional and interactively explorable environment is predominately used for exposure treatment in the behavior therapy setting. The features of VR applications are utilized as a medium between imagined and in vivo confrontation. This article illustrates various applications and compiles findings regarding effectiveness. It is concluded that the exposure treatments using this technology for various described phobias have proven effective. The use of VR for treatment of other psychological illnesses, however, for example trauma disorders, as was demonstrated in the study at hand, is viewed very critically. Finally, research necessities are indicated and psychodynamic facets of VR are discussed.},

	abstract = { The present study examined the effect of visual feedback on the ability to recognise and consolidate pitch information. We trained two groups of nonmusicians to play a piano piece by ear, having one group receiving uninterrupted audiovisual feedback, while allowing the other only to hear, but not see their hand on the keyboard. Results indicate that subjects for whom visual information was deprived showed significantly poorer ability to recognise pitches from the musical piece they had learned. These results are interesting since pitch recognition ability would not intuitively seem to rely on visual feedback. In addition, we show that subjects with previous experience in computer touch-typing made fewer errors during training when trained with no visual feedback, but did not show improved pitch recognition ability posttraining. Our results demonstrate how sensory redundancy increases robustness of learning, and further encourage the use of audiovisual training procedures for facilitating the learning of new skills. },

	abstract = {User perceptual sensitivity to changes of system latency was tested in three simple virtual environments: one with only a foreground object, a second with only a background object, and a third that combined both of these elements. Prior psychophysical measurements of sensitivity, Just Noticeable Difference; and bias, Points of Subjective Equality, from our laboratory are confirmed with measurements in 13 subjects. Our measurements indicate that perceptual stability across a variety of virtual environments will require latencies less than 16 ms. We discount a possible explanation that the differences between our results and those from a study by Allison et al. could be related to a visual capture effect initially reported by L. Matin. Instead, the differences may be due to the type of psychophysical judgment rendered by the subjects and the degree to which subjects were instructed and practiced.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the handling of multimodality in the Embassi system. Here, multimodality is treated in two modules. Firstly, a modality fusion component merges speech, video traced pointing gestures, and input from a graphical user interface. Secondly, a presentation planning component decides upon the modality to be used for the output, i.e., speech, an animated life-like character (ALC) and/or the graphical user interface, and ensures that the presentation is coherent and cohesive. We describe how these two components work and emphasize one particular feature of our system architecture: All modality analysis components generate output in a common semantic description format and all render components process input in a common output language. This makes it particularly easy to add or remove modality analyzers or renderer components, even dynamically while the system is running. This plug and play of modalities can be used to adjust the system's capabilities to different demands of users and their situative context. In this paper we give details about the implementations of the models, protocols and modules that are necessary to realize those features.},

All these different sources of information have to be efficiently merged to form a coherent and robust percept. Here we highlight some of the mechanisms that underlie this merging of the senses in the brain. We show that, depending on the type of information, different combination and integration strategies are used and that prior knowledge is often required for interpreting the sensory signals. },

	abstract = {Rapid development in processing power, graphic cards and mobile computers open up a wide domain for Mixed Reality applications. Thereby the Mixed Reality continuum covers the complete spectrum from Virtual Reality using immersive projection technology to Augmented Reality using mobile systems like Smartphones and UMPCs. At the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics (IGD) the Mixed Reality Framework instantreality (www.instantreality.org) has been developed as a single and consistent interface for AR/VR developers. This framework provides a comprehensive set of features to support classic Virtual Reality (VR) as well as mobile Augmented Reality (AR). The goal is to provide a very simple application interface which includes the latest research results in the fields of high-realistic rendering, 3D user interaction and total-immersive display technology. The system design is based on various industry standards to facilitate application development and deployment.},

	abstract = {A recent development in video games is that players can design and personalize their own in-game characters. It was predicted that this innovation could lead to elevations in the intensity of the psychological effects of video games. The present study confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that participants who played an aggressive video game using their own, personalized character exhibited higher levels of aggressive behavior than participants who played an aggressive game with a non-personalized character. The aggressive behavior levels of the own-character players also exceeded those of individuals who played a non-aggressive game, regardless of whether or not they used a personalized character. Process analyses revealed that participants playing a violent video game with a personalized game character experienced more arousal and self-activation than they did when playing with an impersonal, default game character, which in turn increased aggressive responses.},

	abstract = { Many intelligent interfaces must recognize patterns of user activity that cross a variety of different input channels. These multimodal interfaces offer significant challenges to both the designer and the software engineer. The designer needs a method of expressing interaction patterns that has the power to capture real use cases and a clear semantics. The software engineer needs a processing model that can identify the described interaction patterns efficiently while maintaining meaningful intermediate state to aid in debugging and system maintenanceIn this paper, we describe an input model, a general recognition model, and a series of important classes of recognition parsers with useful computational characteristics; that is, we can say with some certainty how efficient the recognizers will be, and the kind of patterns the recognizers will accept. Examples illustrate the ability of these recognizers to integrate information from multiple channels across varying time intervals. },

@inproceedings{Frohlich:2008aa,
	abstract = {This paper illustrates the temporal synchronization and process flow

 facilities of a real-time simulation system which is based on the ac-
 tor model. The requirements of such systems are compared against
 the actor model's basic features and structures. The paper describes

 how a modular architecture benefits from the actor model on the
 module level and points out how the actor model enhances paral-
 lelism and concurrency even down to the entity level. The actor
 idea is incorporated into a novel simulation core for intelligent vir-
 tual environments (SCIVE). SCIVE supports well-known and es-
 tablished Virtual Reality paradigms like the scene graph metaphor,

 field routing concepts etc. In addition, SCIVE provides an explicit

 semantic representation of its internals as well as of the specific

 virtual environments' contents. SCIVE uses a knowledge represen-
 tation layer (KRL) to tie together the participating modules of a

 simulation system and reflects this information between the mod-
 ules and processes. As a consequence, the actor model based tem-
 poral relations are lifted to the KRL which in turn is implemented

 by a real-time tailored semantic net base formalism. The modules'

 process flow is henceforth described on the KRL. This high-level
 description is extended down to the level of detailed function calls

 between the modules. Functions, their parameters, and their return

 values are reflected on the KRL. This provides an integrative se-
 mantic description and interconnection layer uniformly accessible

 a) for the incorporated technical modules and processes as well as

 b) for the human designers and developers.},

	abstract = {Learning to read is extremely difficult for about 10% of children; they are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder called dyslexia [1 and 2]. The neurocognitive causes of dyslexia are still hotly debated [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12]. Dyslexia remediation is far from being fully achieved [13], and the current treatments demand high levels of resources [1]. Here, we demonstrate that only 12 hr of playing action video games---not involving any direct phonological or orthographic training---drastically improve the reading abilities of children with dyslexia. We tested reading, phonological, and attentional skills in two matched groups of children with dyslexia before and after they played action or nonaction video games for nine sessions of 80 min per day. We found that only playing action video games improved children's reading speed, without any cost in accuracy, more so than 1 year of spontaneous reading development and more than or equal to highly demanding traditional reading treatments. Attentional skills also improved during action video game training. It has been demonstrated that action video games efficiently improve attention abilities [14 and 15]; our results showed that this attention improvement can directly translate into better reading abilities, providing a new, fast, fun remediation of dyslexia that has theoretical relevance in unveiling the causal role of attention in reading acquisition.},

	abstract = {The role of visual-motion coupling delays and cuing order on operator performance and uneasiness was assessed in a driving simulator by means of a response surface methodology central-composite design. The most salient finding of the study was that visual delay appears to be more disruptive to an individual's control performance and well-being than motion delay. Empirical mutliple regression models were derived to predict 10 reliable measures of simulator operator driving performance and comfort. Principal components analysis on these 10 models decomposed the dependent measures into two significant models, which were labeled vestibular disruption and degraded performance. Examination of the empirical models revealed that for asynchronous delay conditions, better performance and wellbeing were achieved when the visual system led the motion system. A secondary analysis of the role of subject gender and perceptual style on susceptibility to simulator sickness revealed that neither of these independent variables was a significant source of variance.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new algorithm for solving the hidden surface (or line) problem, to more rapidly generate realistic images of 3-D scenes composed of polygons, and presents the development of theoretical foundations in the area as well as additional related algorithms. As in many applications the environment to be displayed consists of polygons many of whose relative geometric relations are static, we attempt to capitalize on this by preprocessing the environment's database so as to decrease the run-time computations required to generate a scene. This preprocessing is based on generating a ``binary space partitioning'' tree whose in order traversal of visibility priority at run-time will produce a linear order, dependent upon the viewing position, on (parts of) the polygons, which can then be used to easily solve the hidden surface problem. In the application where the entire environment is static with only the viewing-position changing, as is common in simulation, the results presented will be sufficient to solve completely the hidden surface problem.},

@article{gaggioli:2014a,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent convergence between technology and medicine is offering innovative methods and tools for behavioral health care. Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones).
METHODS: The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations-teachers and nurses-that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation.
RESULTS: Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12\% vs. CG=0.5\%) in chronic "trait" anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14\% vs CG=0.3\%) in the Emotional Support skill.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.

@article{325248,
	abstract = {Clouds present serious problems to standard computer image generation techniques because clouds do not have well-defined surfaces and boundaries. In addition, clouds contain varying degrees of translucence, and their amorphous structure can change with time. Although several approaches to cloud simulation have produced impressive results, they have relied on complex mathematical models which produce high computation costs for a single image.This paper describes a new approach to cloud simulation using simple planar and curved surfaces whose surface shading and translucence are modulated by a mathematical texturing function. This approach represents the appearance of clouds with enough realism for a wide range of visual simulation but does so at a reasonable computational cost, allowing the generation of sequences of images on small minicomputers. In addition, the cloud model can be constructed in a straightforward manner. },

Twenty nine NF1 children and 25 age-and gender-matched controls, aged 8 {\^a}€``16 were assessed in a VC. Parent ratings on the Conners' Parent Rating Scales-Revised; Long (CPRS-R:L) questionnaire was used to monitor for ADHD. Significant differences were found between the NF1 and control groups on the number of targets correctly identified and the number of commission errors in the VC, with NF1 children performing poorer (p\&\#60; 0.005). Significant correlations were found between total correct hit and the cognitive problems/inattention scale and two indexes of the CPRS-R:L (the DSM-IV Symptom Subscales and on the ADHD Index). The attention profile of NF1 children include deficits in sustained attention and impulsivity. These results suggest that the VC is a sensitive and ecologically valid assessment tool to aid in the diagnosis of attention deficits among children with NF1},

	abstract = {<p>Training in action video games can increase the speed of perceptual processing. However, it is unknown whether video-game training can lead to broad-based changes in higher-level competencies such as cognitive flexibility, a core and neurally distributed component of cognition. To determine whether video gaming can enhance cognitive flexibility and, if so, why these changes occur, the current study compares two versions of a real-time strategy (RTS) game. Using a meta-analytic Bayes factor approach, we found that the gaming condition that emphasized maintenance and rapid switching between multiple information and action sources led to a large increase in cognitive flexibility as measured by a wide array of non-video gaming tasks. Theoretically, the results suggest that the distributed brain networks supporting cognitive flexibility can be tuned by engrossing video game experience that stresses maintenance and rapid manipulation of multiple information sources. Practically, these results suggest avenues for increasing cognitive function.</p>},

	abstract = {A method is described which models the interaction of light between diffusely reflecting surfaces. Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the ``color-bleeding'' effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

They use what's know referred to as the Cornell Box to test their results with. The coolest thing about this paper (which isn't often mentioned) is the box is an actual real box, which they built and put under a very careful lighting setup. They then took photos and measurements to compare against the CG model.},

The spatial model yields a natural and readily extensible system, but the current networking tech- nology prevents very large-scale testing of the system.},

	abstract = {MASSIVE is a distributed virtual reality system. It pro- vides rich facilities to support user interaction and coop- eration via text, audio and graphics media, and interaction is controlled by a spatial model of interaction. The communications architecture is based on processes communicating via typed connections which have inter- faces on both ends and which integrate RPCs, attributes and streams in a common context. A spatial interface trad- ing service, the aura manager, has been developed to sup- port interface trading in a spatial context. The concepts embodied in the aura manager can be useful in other interface trading situations, especially where notions of ``space'' and ``meeting'' may be applied.},

	annote = {In an attempt to reduce the communication costs in a shared
 distributed virtual environment (VE) system with a large number of participants,
 we have explored the use of spatial interaction techniques. In particular, we
 have experimented with the notion of an area of interest (AOI) which is
 dynamically established based on the spatial proximity of participants in the
 shared space. The work presented here describes an effort to integrate an
 enhanced aura-based spatial interaction model within the DIVE distributed Virtual
 Environment system and use this to reduce the overall communication load in the
 system. By associating light-weight communication groups to AOIs (area of
 interest), we show how messages are distributed to smaller peer groups, so that
 overall message passing is decreased. A multi-user application scenario is
 implemented as a case study. Real experiments and measurements with the current
 DIVE system using the scenario were made to validate the interaction model and
 its implementation. This work was performed as a joint research effort between
 Sony CSL and SICS as part of the Wide Area Virtual Environment (WAVE) project. },

	abstract = {There is an impedance mismatch between message-passing
 concurrency and virtual machines, such as the JVM. VMs
 usually map their threads to heavyweight OS processes.
 Without a lightweight process abstraction, users are
 often forced to write parts of concurrent applications in
 an event-driven style which obscures control flow, and
 increases the burden on the programmer. In this paper we
 show how thread-based and event-based programming can be
 unified under a single actor abstraction. Using advanced
 abstraction mechanisms of the Scala programming language,
 we implement our approach on unmodified JVMs. Our
 programming model integrates well with the threading
 model of the underlying VM.},

	abstract = {Advanced VR simulation systems are composed of several components with independent and heterogeneously structured databases. To guarantee a closed and consistent world simulation, flexible and robust data exchange between these components has to be realized. This multiple database problem is well known in many distributed application domains, but it is central for VR setups composed of diverse simulation components. Particularly complicated is the exchange between object-centered and graph-based representation formats, where entity attributes may be distributed over the graph structure. This article presents an abstract declarative attribute representation concept, which handles different representation formats uniformly and enables automatic data exchange and synchronization between them. This mechanism is tailored to support the integration of a central knowledge component, which provides a uniform representation of the accumulated knowledge of the several simulation components involved. This component handles the incoming--possibly conflicting--world changes propagated by the diverse components. It becomes the central instance for process flow synchronization of several autonomous evaluation loops.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Excessive pain during medical procedures is a widespread problem but is especially problematic during daily wound care of patients with severe burn injuries.
METHODS: Burn patients report 35-50% reductions in procedural pain while in a distracting immersive virtual reality, and fMRI brain scans show associated reductions in pain-related brain activity during VR. VR distraction appears to be most effective for patients with the highest pain intensity levels. VR is thought to reduce pain by directing patients' attention into the virtual world, leaving less attention available to process incoming neural signals from pain receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: We review evidence from clinical and laboratory research studies exploring Virtual Reality analgesia, concentrating primarily on the work ongoing within our group. We briefly describe how VR pain distraction systems have been tailored to the unique needs of burn patients to date, and speculate about how VR systems could be tailored to the needs of other patient populations in the future.},

Our system, called WireGL, uses a cluster of off-the-shelf PCs connected with a high-speed network. WireGL allows an unmodified existing application to achieve scalable output resolution on such a display. This paper presents an efficient sorting algorithm which minimizes the network traffic for a scalable display. We will demonstrate that for most applications, our system provides scalable output resolution with minimal performance impact. },

Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms.
 The semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information. ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts (e.g. screen resolution and input devices). ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 is intended for a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation of the functionality. For example, ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 does not assume the existence of a mouse or 2D display device.
 Each X3D application:
 implicitly establishes a world coordinate space for all objects defined, as well as all objects included by the application; explicitly defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects; can specify hyperlinks to other files and applications; can define programmatic or data-driven object behaviours; can connect to external modules or applications via programming and scripting languages; explicitly declares its functional requirements by specifying a profile; can declare additional functional requirements by specifying components.},

	abstract = {We present a software model and language for describing and programming the fine-grained aspects of interaction in a non-WIMP user interface, such as a virtual environment. Our approach is based on our view that the essence of a non-WIMP dialogue is a set of continuous relationships?most of which are temporary. The model combines a data-flow or constraint-like component for the continuous relationships with an event-based component for discrete interactions, which can enable or diable individual continuous relationships. To demonstrate our approach, we present the PMIW user interface management system for non-WIMP interactions, a set of examples running under it, a visual editor for our user interface description language, and a discussion of our implemantation and our restricted use of constraints for a performance-driven interactive situation. Our goal is to provide a model and language that captures the formal structure of non-WIMP interactions in the way that various previous techniques have captured command-based, textual, and event-based styles and to suggest that using it need and not compromise real-time performance.},

	abstract = {In order to realize their full potential, multimodal interfaces need to support not just input from multiple modes, but single commands optimally distributed across the available input modes. A multimodal language processing architecture is needed to integrate semantic content from the different modes. Johnston 1998a proposes a modular approach to multimodal language processing in which spoken language parsing is completed before multimodal parsing. In this paper, I will demonstrate the difficulties this approach faces as the spoken language parsing component is expanded to provide a compositional analysis of deictic expressions. I propose an alternative architecture in which spoken and multimodal parsing are tightly interleaved. This architecture greatly simplifies the spoken language parsinggrammarandenablespredictive information from spoken language parsing to drive the application of multimodal parsing and gesture combination rules. I also propose a treatment of deictic numeral expressions that supports the broad range of pen gesture combinations that can be used to refer to collections of objects in the interface.},

	abstract = {The idea of Virtual Prototyping is the use of realistic digital product models for design and functionality analysis in early stages of the product development cycle. The goal of our research is to make modeling of virtual prototypes more intuitive and powerful by using knowledge enhanced Virtual Reality techniques for interactive construction of virtual prototypes from 3D-visualized, CAD-based parts. To this end, a knowledge-based approach for real-time assembly simulation has been developed that draws on dynamically updated representations of part matings and assembly structure. The approach has been implemented in an experimental system, the CODY Virtual Constructor, that supports a variety of interaction modalities, such as direct manipulation, natural language, and gestures.},

	annote = {We present a suitable virtually documented environment system providing the user with high level interaction possibilities. The system is dedicated to applications where the operator needs to have his hands free in order to access information, carry out measurements andlor operate on a device (e.g. maintenance, instruction). The system merges video images acquired through a head-mounted video camera with synthetic data (multimedia documents including CAD models and text) and presents these merged images to the operator Registration techniques allow the operator to visualise information properly correlated to the real world: this is an essential aspect in order to achieve a feeling of presence in a real environment. We increase the sense of immersion through high level Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) allowing hands-free access to information through vocal commands as well as multimodal interaction associating speech and gesture. In this way, the user can access information and manipulate it in a very natural manner. We discuss the construction of the documentation system and the requested functionalities which led to the system architecture. Proceedings of Eurographics '97.},

@inproceedings{Kapolka:2002uq,
	abstract = {If large-scale shared virtual worlds are to be established on the Internet, they must be based on technologies that allow them to adapt, scale, and evolve continuously---that is, without their being taken offline. In the course of designing NPSNET-V, an architecture intended to satisfy these criteria through component- based dynamic extensibility, the authors recognized the need for a consistent, unified component framework. This framework, which they implemented in JavaTM, allows one to construct applications as component hierarchies rooted at an invariant microkernel. A simple extensible interface layer and event model allow components to communicate with one another, and an XML configuration and serialization mechanism permits applications to store and transmit component and application state in a versatile standardized format. After an initial bootstrapping process, one may add, remove, and upgrade components at run time, and one may introduce newly loaded JavaTM code anywhere in the application hierarchy at any time. The complications posed by this reconfigurability and the hierarchical nature of NPSNET-V applications led the authors to develop a consistent design strategy, which they based largely on several common design patterns. The most critical design pattern that they used was the Model-View-Controller pattern, which forms the basis of the NPSNET-V entity model.},

	abstract = {Different hardware platforms are best suited for different tasks in simulating a virtual world. Any distributed virtual world must be prepared to support communication among a large and heterogeneous set of software and hardware devices. By developing a scalable environment for virtual worlds based on heterogeneous platforms, researchers can utilize existing hardware, and so can begin to do research without a large capital outlay. For these reasons, it is imperative to explore the architectural constraints placed on a virtual world by distribution and parallelism. The author examines what it means to distribute functionality such as simulation, interaction detection and messaging in a virtual world, how to "scale up" such a world, and how to deal with communication delays. The WAVES (WAterloo Virtual Environment System) architecture attempts to address these concerns},

Results suggest that a virtual standardized patient can generate responses that elicit user questions relevant for PTSD categorization. We conclude with a discussion of the ways in which these capabilities allow virtual patients to serve as unique training tools whose special knowledge and reactions can be continually fed back to trainees. Our initial goal is to focus on a virtual patient with PTSD, but a similar strategy could be applied to teaching a broad variety of psychiatric diagnoses to trainees at every level from medical students, to psychiatry residents, to child and adolescent psychiatry residents.},

@article{kilteni:2012b,
	abstract = {What does it feel like to own, to control, and to be inside a body? The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.},

@article{kobus:1994a,
	abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate how the mode of stimulus presentation affects recall in the classroom environment. 289 undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of 7 experimental groups. All subjects were presented the same stimuli in one of 7 possible modes: (1) Printed Word, (2) Spoken Word, (3) Picture, (4) Printed Word + Spoken Word, (5) Picture + Spoken Word, (6) Picture + Printed Word, and (7) Printed Word, Picture + Spoken Word. 30 words, 6 from each of 5 categories, were presented to each group. A new stimulus was presented every 5 sec. Subjects were to recall (in writing) as many stimuli as possible in 5 min. regardless of order. One-way between groups analyses of variance were conducted on recall and cluster index scores. A significant main effect of mode of presentation showed that recall was best for the Picture or multimodal group (Printed Word, Picture + Spoken Word). Groups receiving only the spoken or printed word showed significantly poorer recall than the multimodal groups. No statistically significant differences between groups were found on the cluster index score. It appears that the simultaneous presentation of redundant stimuli in multiple modalities does support the multiple-resource hypothesis by displaying enhanced recall when information is available from multiple attentional resources.},

Von den Grundlagen bis hin zu komplexen Themen wie Kryptografie, Grafik- und Netzwerkprogrammierung lernen Sie Java in seiner Gesamtheit kennen. Weiterf{\"u}hrende Themengebiete wie Meta-Informationen im Quellcode, Design Pattern und Objektorientierte Datenbankzugriffe runden das Werk ab und zeigen viele Ankn{\"u}pfungspunkte zur Java Enterprise Edition auf. Anf{\"a}nger erhalten einen leichten Einstieg in Sprache und Klassenbibliotheken, Fortgeschrittene und Profis ein komplettes Nachschlagewerk f{\"u}r die t{\"a}gliche Arbeit mit vielen Querverweisen zu angrenzenden Themen. Durch die klare Sprache und zahlreiche, gut verst{\"a}ndliche Beispielprogramme eignet sich das Buch hervorragend zur Verwendung im Unterricht und zum Selbststudium.
Aus dem Inhalt
Historie, Schnelleinstieg, Troubleshooting Datentypen, Ausdr{\"u}cke, Anweisungen, Schleifen Generics, Enumerationen Objektorientierte Programmierung Design-Patterns Strings, Exceptions, Collection, Utilities, I/O, Regul{\"a}re Ausdr{\"u}cke Grafikprogrammierung mit AWT und Swing Applets Serialisierung Datenbankzugriffe mit JDBC und Java Persistenz API Reflection, Annotationen, Networking, Kryptografie und Sound Performance-Tuning Programmierwerkzeuge
Java ist als universelle, plattformunabh{\"a}ngige und eine der meistverwendeten Programmiersprachen weltweit etabliert und hat nahezu jeden Bereich der IT erfasst. Ca. 54% aller Entwickler programmieren heute mit Java. Die Liste der programmierten Anwendungen umfasst Datenbank-Applikationen, grafische Benutzeroberfl{\"a}chen, dynamische Webanwendungen und Web Services. Auch bei der Programmierung von Handys, PDAs oder Kreditkarten-applikationen kommt Java inzwischen zum Einsatz. Das {\"u}berarbeitete "Handbuch der Java-Programmierung" zur SE 6 ist das deutsche Standardwerk zur Sprache Java schlechthin und gestattet gleichzeitig den Blick {\"u}ber den Tellerrand, bei dem viele Ankn{\"u}pfungspunkte beispielsweise zur Java Enterprise Edition gegeben werden. Anf{\"a}nger erhalten einen leichten Einstieg in Sprache und Klassen-bibliotheken, Fortgeschrittene sowie Profis ein komplettes Nachschlagewerk f{\"u}r die t{\"a}gliche Arbeit. Sie lernen Java in seiner Gesamtheit kennen, von den Grundlagen der objektorientierten Programmierung bis hin zu komplexen Themen wie Grafik- und Netzwerkprogrammierung oder auch Kryptografie. Zus{\"a}tzlich werden weiterf{\"u}hrende Themengebiete wie Meta-Informationen im Quellcode mit Hilfe von Annotationen, speichereffizientes Programmieren, Design Pattern und objektorientierte Persistenz behandelt. Durch die klare Sprache und zahlreiche, gut verst{\"a}ndliche Beispielprogramme eignet sich das Buch hervorragend zur Verwendung im Unterricht und zum Selbststudium.Auf der DVD finden Sie alles, um sofort loszulegen.Und der Farbteil mit Fotos aus Java und Umgebung soll Sie ein bischen auf das Thema einstimmen.},

Other surveys have considered multimodal interactive systems; we focus more closely on the design, specification, construction and evaluation of fusion engines. We first introduce some terminology and set out the major challenges that fusion engines propose to solve. A history of past work in the field of fusion engines is then presented using the BRETAM model. These approaches to fusion are then classified. The classification considers the types of application, the fusion principles and the temporal aspects. Finally, the challenges for future work in the field of fusion engines are set out. These include software frameworks, quantitative evaluation, machine learning and adaptation.},

These predictions were tested experimentally. In the first study, videos were used as the stimuli for opposite-sex participants where an actor/actress performed verbal self-presentations. The content was alike but was delivered with three levels of verbal proficiency with respect to lexical, grammatical, and fluency features. The main effect of verbal proficiency on attractiveness was supported, but the interaction effect was not supported between verbal proficiency and sex according to which male more than female attractiveness is affected by verbal proficiency. In the second study, only audio tracks from the videos were used. Both effects were significant, supporting the assertion that language plays a significant role in mate choice, especially for male attractiveness.},

@book{lanza:2006,
	abstract = {Metrics are paramount in every engineering discipline. Software engineering, however, is not considered a classical engineering activity for several reasons. In general, if a software system is seen to deliver the required functionality, only few people if any care about the internals. Moreover, defining, understanding and applying software metrics often looks like an overly complex activity, recommended only to 'trained professionals'.

Lanza and Marinescu demystify the design metrics used to assess the size, quality and complexity of object-oriented software systems. Based on statistical information from many industrial projects and generally accepted semantics they deduce many single and combined threshold values. They show in detail how to identify collaboration and classification disharmony patterns in code, how to visualize their results using the freely available CodeCrawler visualization tool, and how to devise possible remedies.

The combination of theoretically sound results and practically tested procedures and solution paths makes this book an ideal companion for professional software architects, developers and quality engineers. The pattern-oriented description of disharmonies offers easy access to detecting shortcomings and applying solution strategies.},

	abstract = {Simulator X is a software research platform for intelligent Real-time Interactive Systems. Based on the actor model, it supports fine grained concurrency and parallelism. The architecture uses actors to realize a distributed application state and execution model which is mapped to an object-centered global and coherent world view based on entities. The architecture pays specific attention to the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. Entities are associated with specific properties. These properties are realized by so called state variables. State variable access is implicitly relayed to individual actors guarding access to them. The underlying asynchronous event mechanism is based on the actors' message passing facility to provide intra- and interprocess communication. It supports typical read/write access as well as change notification and snapshot services. An extensible world interface uses a semantic annotation layer grounded into an ontology to provide a coherent world view of the distributed world state and execution model. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for incorporation of different Artificial Intelligence components. The system is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability. The platform is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games.},

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	abstract = {From 1st to 6th June 2008, the Dagstuhl Seminar 08231 ``Virtual Realities'' was held in the International Conference and Research Center (IBFI), Schloss Dagstuhl. Virtual Reality (VR) is a multidisciplinary area of research aimed at interactive human-computer mediated simulations of artificial environments. Typical applications include simulation, training, scientific visualization, and entertainment. An important aspect of VR-based systems is the stimulation of the human senses -- typically sight, sound, and touch -- such that a user feels a sense of presence (or immersion) in the virtual environment. Different applications require different levels of presence, with corresponding levels of realism, sensory immersion, and spatiotemporal interactive fidelity. During the seminar, several participants presented their current research, and ongoing work and open problems were discussed. Abstracts of the presentations given during the seminar as well as abstracts of seminar results and ideas are put together in this paper. Links to extended abstracts or full papers are provided, if available.

 Article abstract:

 The complexity of interactive 3D graphics systems continuously grows. Animated
 virtual worlds require several processes to generate a believable and consistent
 user impression. Advanced audio, physics, or AI-behaviors - to name a few - are
 nowadays omnipresent in research as well as in entertainment applications. This
 talk introduces a novel design and development paradigm for such interactive

 and complex systems. ﰐSemantic Reﰝectionﰑ extends the well known reﰝection
 principle of current programming languages using an explicit semantic layer. It
 facilitates a uniform and integrative design of architectures, layouts, and inter-
 faces even for complex systems. In addition, the paradigm provides an implicit
 AI representation useful - if not necessary - in areas like, e.g., multimodal inter-
 action, physical simulation, or intelligent virtual agents.},

	abstract = {This article presents a gesture detection and analysis framework for modelling multimodal interactions. It is particulary designed for its use in Virtual Reality (VR) applications and contains an abstraction layer for different sensor hardware. Using the framework, gestures are described by their characteristic spatio-temporal features which are on the lowest level calculated by simple predefined detector modules or nodes. These nodes can be connected by a data routing mechanism to perform more elaborate evaluation functions, therewith establishing complex detector nets. Typical problems that arise from the time-dependent invalidation of multimodal utterances under immersive conditions lead to the development of pre-evaluation concepts that as well support their integration into scene graph based systems to support traversal-type access. Examples of realized interactions illustrate applications which make use of the described concepts.},

The framework introduces a Knowledge Representation Layer which augments objects of the simulated environment with Semantic Entities as a central object model that bridges and interfaces Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) representations. Specialized node types use these facilities to implement required processing tasks like gesture detection, preprocessing of the visual scene for multimodal integration, or translation of movements into multimodally
 initialized gestural interactions. A modified Augmented Transition Nettwork (ATN) approach accesses the knowledge layer as well as the preprocessing components to integrate linguistic, gestural, and context information in parallel. The overall framework emphasizes extensibility, adaptivity and reusability, e.g., by utilizing persistent and interchangeable XML-based formats to describe its processing stages.},

@inproceedings{latoschik:2005:knowledge_in_loop,
	abstract = {This article describes the integration of knowledge based techniques into simulative Virtual Reality (VR) applications. The approach is motivated using multimodal Virtual Construction as an example domain. An abstract Knowledge Representation Layer (KRL) is proposed which is expressive enough to define all necessary data for diverse simulation tasks and which additionally provides a base formalism for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) representations. The KRL supports two different implementation methods. The first method uses XSLT processing to transform the external KRL format into the representation formats of the diverse target systems. The second method implements the KRL using a functionally extendable semantic network. The semantic net library is tailored for real time simulation systems where it interconnects the required simulation modules and establishes access to the knowledge representations inside the simulation loop. The KRL promotes a novel object model for simulated objects called Semantic Entities which provides a uniform access to the KRL and which allows extensive system modularization. The KRL approach is demonstrated in two simulation areas. First, a generalized scene graph representation is presented
 which introduces an abstract definition and implementation of geometric node interrelations. It supports scene and application structures which can not be expressed using common scene hierarchies or field route concepts. Second, the KRL's expressiveness is demonstrated in the design of multimodal interactions. Here, the KRL defines the knowledge particularly required during the semantic analysis of multimodal user utterances.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces semantic reflection, a novel concept for a modular design of intelligent applications. SCIVE, a simulation core for intelligent Virtual Environments (IVEs), provides semantic reflection on multiple layers: SCIVE's architecture grants semantic driven uniform access to low-level simulation core logic, to specific simulation modules' application definitions, as well as to high-level semantic environment descriptions. It additionally provides a frame to conveniently interconnect various simulation modules, e.g., for graphics, physics, audio, haptics, or AI etc. SCIVE's Knowledge Representation Layer's base formalism provides the central organizing structure for the diverse modules' data representations. It allows bidirectional knowledge driven access between the modules since their specific data structures and functions are transitively reflected by the semantic layer. Hence SCIVE preserves, integrates and provides unified access to the development paradigms of the interconnected modules, e.g., scene graph metaphors or field route concepts etc. well known from todays Virtual Reality systems. SCIVE's semantic reflection implementation details are illustrated following a complex example application. We illustrate how semantic reflection and modularity support extensibility and maintainability of VR applications, potential for automatic system configuration and optimization, as well as the base for comprehensive knowledge driven access for IVEs.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces SCIVE, a Simulation Core for Intelligent Virtual Environments. SCIVE provides a Knowledge Representation Layer (KRL) as a central organizing structure. Based on a semantic net, it ties together the data representations of the various simulation modules, e.g., for graphics, physics, audio, haptics or Artificial Intelligence (AI) representations. SCIVE's open architecture allows a seamless integration and modification of these modules. Their data synchronization is widely customizable to support extensibility and maintainability. Synchronization can be controlled through filters which in turn can be instantiated and parametrized by any of the modules, e.g., the AI component can be used to change an object's behavior to be controlled by the physics instead of the interaction- or a keyframe-module. This bidirectional inter-module access is mapped by, and routed through, the KRL which semantically reflects all objects or entities the simulation comprises. Hence, SCIVE allows extensive application design and customization from low-level core logic, module configuration and flow control, to the simulated scene, all on a high-level unified representation layer while it supports well known development paradigms commonly found in Virtual Reality applications.},

Whereas techniques for visual presentation have reached a high level of maturity in recent years, many of the input devices and interaction techniques still tend to be awkward for this new media. Where the borders between real and artificial environments vanish, a more natural way of interaction is desirable. To this end, we investigate the benefits of integrated speech- and gesture-based interfaces for interacting with virtual environments. Our research results are applied within a virtual construction scenario, where 3D visualized mechanical objects can be spatially rearranged and assembled using speech- and gesture-based communication.},

	abstract = {Developing state of the art multimedia applications nowadays calls for the use of sophisticated visualisation and immersion techniques, commonly referenced as Virtual Reality. While Virtual Reality meanwhile reaches good results both in image quality and in fast user feedback using parallel computation techniques, the methods for interacting with these systems need to be improved. In this paper we introduce a multimedia application that uses a gesture-driven interface and, secondly, the architecture for an expandable gesture recognition system. After different gesture types for interaction in a virtual environment are discussed with respect to a required functionality, the implementation of a specific gesture detection module for distant pointing recognition is described, and the whole system design is tested for its task adequacy.},

	abstract = {Past multisensory experiences can influence current unisensory processing and memory performance. Repeated images are better discriminated if initially presented as auditory-visual pairs, rather than only visually. An experience's context thus plays a role in how well repetitions of certain aspects are later recognized. Here, we investigated factors during the initial multisensory experience that are essential for generating improved memory performance. Subjects discriminated repeated versus initial image presentations intermixed within a continuous recognition task. Half of initial presentations were multisensory, and all repetitions were only visual. Experiment 1 examined whether purely episodic multisensory information suffices for enhancing later discrimination performance by pairing visual objects with either tones or vibrations. We could therefore also assess whether effects can be elicited with different sensory pairings. Experiment 2 examined semantic context by manipulating the congruence between auditory and visual object stimuli within blocks of trials. Relative to images only encountered visually, accuracy in discriminating image repetitions was significantly impaired by auditory-visual, yet unaffected by somatosensory-visual multisensory memory traces. By contrast, this accuracy was selectively enhanced for visual stimuli with semantically congruent multisensory pasts and unchanged for those with semantically incongruent multisensory pasts. The collective results reveal opposing effects of purely episodic versus semantic information from auditory-visual multisensory events. Nonetheless, both types of multisensory memory traces are accessible for processing incoming stimuli and indeed result in distinct visual object processing, leading to either impaired or enhanced performance relative to unisensory memory traces. We discuss these results as supporting a model of object-based multisensory interactions.},

	annote = {Many ways of communications are used between human and computer, while using gesture is considered to be one of the most natural way in a virtual reality system. Because of its intuitiveness and its capability of helping the hearing inipaired or speaking impaired, we develop a gesture recognition system. Considering the world-wide use of ASL (American Sign Language), this system focuses on the recognition ofa continuous flow of alphabets in ASL to spell a word folloived by the speech synthesis, and adopts a simple and efficient windowed template matching recognition strategy to achieve the goal of a real-time and continuous recognition. In addition to the abduction and the flex information in a gesture, we introduce a concept of contact-point into our system to solve the intrinsic ambiguities of some gestures in ASL. Five tact switches, served as contact-points and sensed by an analogue to digital board, are sewn on a glove cover to enhance the functions of a traditional data glove.

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	abstract = {We investigate the appearance-based gaze estimation problem, with respect to its essential difficulty in reducing the number of required training samples, and other practical issues such as slight head motion, image resolution variation, and eye blinking. We cast the problem as mapping high-dimensional eye image features to low-dimensional gaze positions, and propose an adaptive linear regression (ALR) method as the key to our solution. The ALR method adaptively selects an optimal set of sparsest training samples for the gaze estimation via ℓ1-optimization. In this sense, the number of required training samples is significantly reduced for high accuracy estimation. In addition, by adopting the basic ALR objective function, we integrate the gaze estimation, subpixel alignment and blink detection into a unified optimization framework. By solving these problems simultaneously, we successfully handle slight head motion, image resolution variation and eye blinking in appearance-based gaze estimation. We evaluated the proposed method by conducting experiments with multiple users and variant conditions to verify its effectiveness.},

Intuition suggests that, with these new capabilities to create avatars that look like their users, every player should have his or her own avatar to play videogames or simulations. We explicitly test the impact of having one's own avatar (vs. a yoked control avatar) in a simulation (i.e., maze running task with mines). We test the impact of avatar identity on both subjective (e.g., feeling connected and engaged, liking avatar's appearance, feeling upset when avatar's injured, enjoying the game) and behavioral variables (e.g., time to complete task, speed, number of mines triggered, riskiness of maze path chosen). Results indicate that having an avatar that looks like the user improves their subjective experience, but there is no significant effect on how users behave in the simulation.},

 Artificial intelligence is a diverse field. To ask the question {"}what is intelligence?{"} is to invite as many answers as there are approaches to the subject of artificial intelligence. These could be intelligent agents, logical reasoning, neural networks, expert systems, evolutionary computing and so on. This fifth edition covers all the main strategies used for creating computer systems that will behave in "intelligent" ways. It combines the broadest approach of any text in the marketplace with the practical information necessary to implement the strategies discussed, showing how to do this through Prolog or LISP programming.},

	abstract = {After half a century of cognitive revolution we remain far from agreement about what cognition is and what cognition does. It was once thought that these questions could wait until the data were in. Today there is a mountain of data, but no way of making sense of it. The time for tackling the fundamental issues has arrived. The biogenic approach to cognition is introduced not as a solution but as a means of approaching the issues. The traditional, and still predominant, methodological stance in cognitive inquiry is what I call the anthropogenic approach: assume human cognition as the paradigm and work `down' to a more general explanatory concept. The biogenic approach, on the other hand, starts with the facts of biology as the basis for theorizing and works `up' to the human case by asking psychological questions as if they were biological questions. Biogenic explanations of cognition are currently clustered around two main frameworks for understanding biology: self-organizing complex systems and autopoiesis. The paper describes the frameworks and infers from them ten empirical principles---the biogenic `family traits'---that constitute constraints on biogenic theorizing. Because the anthropogenic approach to cognition is not constrained empirically to the same degree, I argue that the biogenic approach is superior for approaching a general theory of cognition as a natural phenomenon.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present our findings from a lab and a field study investigating how passers-by notice the interactivity of public displays. We designed an interactive installation that uses visual feedback to the incidental movements of passers-by to communicate its interactivity. The lab study reveals: (1) Mirrored user silhouettes and images are more effective than avatar-like representations. (2) It takes time to notice the interactivity (approx. 1.2s). In the field study, three displays were installed during three weeks in shop windows, and data about 502 interaction sessions were collected. Our observations show: (1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+90%) or silhouette (+47%) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice interactivity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect). (3) If somebody is already interacting, others begin interaction behind the ones already interacting, forming multiple rows (the honeypot effect). Our findings can be used to design public display applications and shop windows that more effectively communicate interactivity to passers-by.},

@inproceedings{mosenlechner:2009a,
	abstract = { Planning means deciding on the future course of action based on
 predictions of what will happen when an activity is carried out in
 one way or the other. As we apply action planning to autonomous,
 sensor-guided mobile robots with manipulators or even to humanoid
 robots we need very realistic and detailed predictions of the
 behavior generated by a plan in order to improve the robot's
 performance substantially.

 In this paper we investigate the high-fidelity temporal projection
 of realistic robot behavior based on physics- and sensor-based
 simulation systems. We equip a simulator and interpreter with means
 to log simulated plan executions into a database. A logic-based
 query and inference mechanism then retrieves and reconstructs the
 necessary information from the database and translates the
 information into a first-order representation of robot plans and the
 behavior they generate. The query language enables the robot
 planning system to infer the intentions, the beliefs, and the world
 state at any projected time. It also allows the planning system to
 recognize, diagnose, and analyze various plan failures typical for
 performing everyday manipulation tasks. },

@article{madary:2016a,
	abstract = {The goal of this article is to present a first list of ethical concerns that may arise from research and personal use of virtual reality (VR) and related technology, and to offer concrete recommendations for minimizing those risks. Many of the recommendations call for focused research initiatives. In the first part of the article, we discuss the relevant evidence from psychology that motivates our concerns. In Section ``Plasticity in the Human Mind,'' we cover some of the main results suggesting that one's environment can influence one's psychological states, as well as recent work on inducing illusions of embodiment. Then, in Section ``Illusions of Embodiment and Their Lasting Effect,'' we go on to discuss recent evidence indicating that immersion in VR can have psychological effects that last after leaving the virtual environment. In the second part of the article, we turn to the risks and recommendations. We begin, in Section ``The Research Ethics of VR,'' with the research ethics of VR, covering six main topics: the limits of experimental environments, informed consent, clinical risks, dual-use, online research, and a general point about the limitations of a code of conduct for research. Then, in Section ``Risks for Individuals and Society,'' we turn to the risks of VR for the general public, covering four main topics: long-term immersion, neglect of the social and physical environment, risky content, and privacy. We offer concrete recommendations for each of these 10 topics, summarized in Table 1.},

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	annote = {Growth point. speech synchronized gesture. Vergleich mit der Bildung von verbalen Ausdr{\"u}cken. Nach psychonlinguistischer Ansicht gibt es mentale Prozesse welche wie grammatikalische Strukturen organisiert sind. Prozesse zur Verbbildung, zum Anf{\"u}gen von Locationsphrasen oder um Subjekt und Verbphrase zu verbinden. Auf niedrigerem Niveau werden dann die rechten lexikalischen W{\"o}rter ausgew{\"a}hlt, Zeiten gew{\"a}hlt etc. Es gibt also (hierarchisch) Subprozesse f{\"u}r die grammatikalischen Substituenten u. {\"a}.. AS: Vygotskys These wird best{\"a}rkt: {\"A}u{\ss}erungen sind entfaltende Erschaffensprozesse. Growth Points sind minimale psychlogische Einheiten (n. Vygotsky), Minimale Einheiten welche essentielle Eigenschaften des Ganzen erhalten, z. Bsp. Dargebotene Bedeutung metaphorischer/bildsymbolischer und linguistischer Kategorien. Growth points: 1. Theoretische Einheiten bei der {\"A}u{\ss}erungsgenerierung welche eine Mentale {\"A}nderung, Differenzierung, Internalisierung, Dialektik und Reorgansisation erkl{\"a}ren. 2. Initale Form eines einen dynamischen Prozess begr{\"u}ndenden Gedanken. 3. Mentale Vorg{\"a}nge sind kontinuierlich. GP sind ein Konzept eines definiten Starvogangs eines entstehenden Gedanken. Reduzierung der GP zu linguistischen und gestischen Komponente w{\"u}rde sie zerst{\"o}ren. Genrealisierung aus Cross-linguistischen UNtersuchungen: 1. GP is eine Einheit in allen Sprachen. 2. Minimaler GP des Denkens-f{\"u}r-Sprechen beinhalted irreversibel metaphorischen/bildersymbolischen und linguistischen "kategorischen" Inhalt. 3. GP hat den Kontext beim Sprechen als fundamentale Komponente. Letzteres ist die Basis um GPs auf andere als grammatikalische Strukturen zu mappen. GP als Kombination metaph./bildsym. kategorischer Information. Die Analysen basieren auf "catchments", also Einzugsgebieten. (BEM.: In den geschilderten narrativen Dialogen ist der Konbtext sehr knifflig, manchmal metaphorisch. Noch zu vergleichen mit Konstrukt./Instrukt. Beziehung.) Es finden sich aber auch hier Beispiele mimetischer und ikonischer Gesten. (BEM.: Inhaltsanalyse ist wichtig. Inhalt ist Basis f{\"u}r eine gelingende Integration.) Jede {\"a}u{\ss}erung beinhaltet Inhalt au{\ss}erhalb ihrer Struktur. Inkooperation statt Zuf{\"u}gung von Au{\ss}en. AS.: Gesten klammern Aussagen in grammatikalischen Einheiten. AS.: Keine feste Form->Bedeutungs Relation. Es ist die Synchronisation zwischen den Modalit{\"a}ten welche die Bedeutung bestimmt. Die Formulierung der GPs ist die Betonung und Differenzierung des Neuene auf dem Feld der Opposition. Gesten sind in diesem Kontext nicht intentional ausgef{\"u}hrt. Es folgen Betrachtungen zum Zusammenhang mit dem Theorien {\"u}ber das Bewu{\ss}tsein. Es finden isch hier gute M{\"o}glichkeiten Affekt und Willen in die Auswahl der GPs einzuordnen. Visuospatiale Kognition und Gestik sind Teil des Spezialmodus im GP-basierten Modell. Nach Vygotsky: {\"A}u{\ss}erung sind Prozesse und keine feste Abbildung von Meinung auf Sound, sie entstehen graduell in der Zeit. GPs sind die Schnappsch{\"u}sse der Startpunkte der {\"A}u{\ss}erungen. GPs k{\"o}nnen aus der Sprach-Gesten Synchronit{\"a}t interferiert werden, gest{\"u}tzt durch Kontextanalyse in welcher der GP differentiert wird, als funktionale Kooperation zwischen Bild und Sprach Kategorie, und von plausiblen Entfaltungsstrategien. GPs sind k{\"o}nnten eine Einheit im Bewu{\ss}tseinsstrom darstellen. Gute Notation f{\"u}r Sprach-Gestik.},

	annote = {This paper presents a description of ISAAC; the Immersive Simulation Animation And Construction program designed and built at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). ISAAC is a scene composition application used for the interactive construction of virtual worlds. In ISAAC you work directly in a virtual environment; you position, orient and scale objects using direct and indirect manipulation techniques. ISAAC stores object configurations in ASCII files that it uses to recreate scenes at a later date for further manipulation and interactive exploration. ISAAC is not a modeling program; you create worlds by manipulating pre-generated three-dimensional models (which can come from sources such as computer-aided design programs or three-dimensional scanning devices). ISAAC was designed to overcome some of the limitations of working in a virtual environment and to take advantage of the natural and intuitive forms of interaction available in a virtual world.},

@techreport{mosses:1996:actionsemantics,
	abstract = {Action Semantics is a framework for the formal description of programming languages. Its main advantage over other frameworks is pragmatic: action-semantic descriptions (ASDs) scale up smoothly to realistic programming languages. This is due to the inherent extensibil- ity and modifiability of ASDs, ensuring that extensions and changes to the described language require only proportionate changes in its descrip- tion. (In denotational or operational semantics, adding an unforeseen construct to a language may require a reformulation of the entire de- scription.)
After sketching the background for the development of action semantics, we summarize the main ideas of the framework, and provide a simple illustrative example of an ASD. We identify which features of ASDs are crucial for good pragmatics. Then we explain the foundations of action semantics, and survey recent advances in its theory and practical applications. Finally, we assess the prospects for further development and use of action semantics.
The action semantics framework was initially developed at the Univer- sity of Aarhus by the present author, in collaboration with David Watt (University of Glasgow). Groups and individuals scattered around five continents have since contributed to its theory and practice.},

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	abstract = {The power and versatility of multimodal interfaces results in an increased complexity of the code to be developed. To address this problem of software development, multimodal interfaces therefore make necessary the definition of software development tools that satisfy specific requirements such as the fusion of data from different interaction modalities and the management of multiple processes including support for synchronization and race conditions between distinct interaction modalities. This chapter is a reflection on current software design methods and tools for multimodal interfaces. First we present the PAC-Amodeus software architectural model as a generic conceptual solution for addressing the challenges of data fusion and concurrent processing of data of multimodal interfaces. We then focus on software tools for developing multimodal interfaces. The existing tools dedicated to multimodal interfaces are currently few and limited in scope. Either they address a specific technical problem including the fusion mechanism, the composition of several devices and mutual disambiguation, or they are dedicated to specific interaction modalities such as gesture recognition, speech recognition or the combined usage of speech and gesture. Two platforms, ICARE and OpenInterface are more general and are able to handle various interaction modalities. We describe in detail these two platforms and illustrate them by considering developed multimodal interfaces. },

@article{OBrien2006,
	abstract = {Although connectionism is advocated by its proponents as an alternative to the classical computational theory of mind, doubts persist about its computational credentials. Our aim is to dispel these doubts by explaining how connectionist networks compute. We first develop a generic account of computation---no easy task, because computation, like almost every other foundational concept in cognitive science, has resisted canonical definition. We opt for a characterisation that does justice to the explanatory role of computation in cognitive science. Next we examine what might be regarded as the ``conventional'' account of connectionist computation. We show why this account is inadequate and hence fosters the suspicion that connectionist networks are not genuinely computational. Lastly, we turn to the principal task of the paper: the development of a more robust portrait of connectionist computation. The basis of this portrait is an explanation of the representational capacities of connection weights, supported by an analysis of the weight configurations of a series of simulated neural networks.},

Each has a tendency to drift away from a dialectical interpretation of loose coupling toward a unidimensional interpretation of loose coupling, thereby weakening the explanatory value of the concept. The authors first use the five voices to review the loose coupling literature and then to suggest more precise and more productive uses of the concept.},

	abstract = {MPEG-4 is the first international standard that stan- dardizes true multimedia communication -- including natural and synthetic audio, natural and synthetic video, as well as 3D graphics. Integrated into this standard is the capability to define and animate virtual humans con- sisting of synthetic heads and bodies. For the head, more than 70 model-independent animation parameters defin- ing low-level actions like move left mouth corner up to high-level parameters like facial expressions and visemes are standardized. In a communication application, the encoder can define the face model using MPEG-4 BInary Format for Scenes (BIFS) and transmit it to the decoder. Alternatively, the encoder can rely on a face model avail- able at the decoder. The animation parameters are quan- tized, predictively encoded using an arithmetic encoder or a DCT. The decoder receives the model and the animation parameters in order to animate the model. Since MPEG-4 defines the minimum MPEG-4 terminal capabilities in profiles and levels, the encoder knows the quality of the animation at the decoder.},

Der Ansatz von Semantic VE beschreibt einen skalierbaren Ansatz - basierend auf RDF als Beschreibungssprache. 1. VE Heute sind VE eng an Systeme gebunden: in Eingabe, speziellem Wissen, Pr{\"a}sentation, In der Verbindung von VUmgebungen wird dadurch eine Reprogrammierung von grosen Teilen Adaption notwendig. Beides ist aufwendig und fehleranf{\"a}llig. Als Beispiel wird die Zusammenarbeit und verbindung von Museen angef{\"u}hrt (Ausstellungen sollen zusammengef{\"u}hrt). => Alle beteiligten Pr{\"a}sentationsplattformen m{\"u}ssen alle beteiligten Datenformate verstehen - und in der Bereitstellung von speziellen Funktionen {\"u}ber der Pr{\"a}sentation (durch z.B. Agenten) auch alles Wissen f{\"u}r die ben{\"o}tigte Funktionalit{\"a}t erweitern und damit m{\"u}ssen {\"u}ber allem Wissen alle Aktionen verf{\"u}gbar sein. Durch eine einfache Umsetzung im Austausch der Daten wird dabei an den einzelnen Orten nicht das gesamte Wissen verf{\"u}gbar, sondern nur aus der speziellen Art des dortigen Mechanismus zur Interaktion und zur Pr{\"a}sentation. 2. Semantic VE Ansatz: Trennen der domain spezifischen Semantik von Repr{\"a}sentationen und Nachrichten. Darstellen der allg. Repr. in RDF. F{\"a}higkeiten: Uniform access to hetereogenous environments scalable access according to client needs, machine understanding for agents, and presentation independence for humans. Spezielle SVE statements beschreiben Beziehungen zwischen Objekten (contains) aber nicht deren Umsetzung in der speziellen Sicht. SVE statements sind nicht statisch sondern dynamisch - k{\"o}nnen damit auch Dinge wie Netzwerkverbindungen enthalten (f{\"u}r Chat oder so). Nachrichten: Nicht Nachrichtenprotokoll - sondern abstrakte events: Beschrieben durch RDF Statement (ist noch in Arbeit). 3. Future Work Zeigen der Verbindung zur Domain Semantik (Konkrete Umsetzung in Anbindung an eine VR Engine oder {\"a}hnliches) Metalevel zur Beschreibung der Verarbeitung von Events.},

	abstract = {The growing interest in multimodal interface design is inspired in large part by the goals of supporting more transparent, flexible, efficient, and powerfully expressive means of human- computer interaction than in the past. Multimodal interfaces are expected to support a wider range of diverse applications, to be usable by a broader spectrum of the average population, and to function more reliably under realistic and challenging usage conditions. In this paper, we summarize the emerging architectural approaches for interpreting speech and pen-based gestural input in a robust manner--- including early and late fusion approaches, and the new hybrid symbolic/statistical approach. We also describe a diverse collection of state-of-the-art multimodal systems that process users' spoken and gestural input. These applications range from map-based and virtual reality systems for engaging in simulations and training, to field medic systems for mobile use in noisy environments, to web-based transactions and standard text-editing applications that will reshape daily computing and have a significant commercial impact. To realize successful multimodal systems of the future, many key research challenges remain to be addressed. Among these challenges are the development of cognitive theories to guide multimodal system design, and the development of effective natural language processing, dialogue processing, and error handling techniques. In addition, new multimodal systems will be needed that can function more robustly and adaptively, and with support for collaborative multi-person use. Before this new class of systems can proliferate, toolkits also will be needed to promote software development for both simulated and functioning systems.},

	abstract = {For 14 teams of three young men, salivary testosterone and cortisol were assessed twice before and twice after competing in within-group and between-group video games that simulated violent male--male competition. Men who contributed the most to their teams' between-group victory showed testosterone increases immediately after the competition, but only if this competition was played before the within-group tournament. High-scoring men on losing teams did not show this immediate effect, but they did show a delayed increase in testosterone. In contrast, high-ranking men tended to have lower testosterone and higher cortisol during within-group tournaments. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that men's competitive testosterone response varies across ingroup and outgroup competitions and is muted during the former. The testosterone response during the between-group competition also suggests that violent multiplayer video games may be appealing to young men because they simulate male--male coalitional competition.},
	annote = {From: http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/04/unreal-hormones-males-treat-games-as-social-competitions.ars
The next time your girlfriend, wife, or mother complains about all the time you spend playing PS3 or online games, you can tell her that your attraction to video games may actually be a by-product of evolution. Scientists at the University of Missouri have found that hormonal surges in men playing violent multiplayer videogames are very similar to hormonal responses males of other species experience during reproductive and territorial challenges. These responses may be evolutionarily hard-wired to help males succeed in coalitionary combat against competitors. 
For the study, 42 undergraduate subjects were randomly assigned to three-person teams and each played in two different rounds: the ``outgroup'' competition between their team and an opposing team, and the ``ingroup'' competition, in which each player was pitted against their own teammates. Unreal Tournament 2004, in which multiple armed players compete in an arena, was the game of choice. In the outgroup competition, teams played in the Onslaught mode, in which each team competes to destroy the opposing team's power core, located at their home base. During the ingroup competition, subjects used the Death Match mode, a free-for-all in which players compete to inflict the most damage on their competitors.
The researchers gave each team 6 hours to practice together before the actual competition began. This practice time also gave each team the opportunity to bond and build a group identity, as social animals do when forming coalitions to compete against other groups of males. During the actual tournament, opposing teams were separated by a partition, allowing members of the same team to see, hear, and interact with each other. All tournaments occurred in the early afternoon, were 30 minutes long, and ended with a clear winner. To test hormone activity, each player's saliva was collected at regular intervals both before and after the competitions.
Directly following the outgroup competition, men on winning teams had much higher testosterone levels than the members of the losing teams. This effect was especially strong for the players who had contributed the most to the team's victory. In animals, a similar hormonal pattern occurs: testosterone levels increase in all competitors to increase aggression and enhance competitive ability, but the most successful males often experience strong post-contest testosterone surges.
Interestingly, when playing against their own teammates in the ingroup part of the tournament, all players showed a decrease in testosterone, with the best males actually having the lowest levels. This muted testosterone response may be an evolved mechanism to blunt the intensity of ingroup competition. It's not particularly adaptive for males of any species to engage in intense competition with their allies, since they run the risk of damaging group cohesion and decreasing their success in later competitions with opposing groups.
These hormone results show that men seem to react to video games in a similar physiological way to male animals that are competing for mates or defending territory. Multiplayer videogames such as Unreal Tournament 2004 may simulate situations in which men are naturally predisposed to work with other group members to form strategies, engage in combat, and eliminate a social threat. Just remember, guys: it's only a game.},

	abstract = {Clark and Chalmers (1998) have argued that mental states can be extended outside an organism's skin. In response to some worries about the availability, reliability and portability of such extended resources, Clark (2005) offers a set of rough criteria that non-biological objects must fulfil to legitimately ground mental states. One such criterion is that the information retrieved from these non-biological sources be (more or less) automatically endorsed. But Sterelny (2003, 2005) has persuasively argued that the extended sphere is epistemologically opaque: a domain of contested truth and deliberate deception. As such, retrieving information from this domain requires the deployment of social guards for the information to remain reliable. But deploying such guards would seem to endanger endorsability by increasing cognitive load. Here I demonstrate that deploying social guards does not increase cognitive load if the guards are implemented in a highly distributed connectionist economy or off-loaded to the external environment.},

Dieser argumentierte, dass die Verwendung von externer, in einer sozialen Umgebung vorhandener, Informationen nicht resourcen-schonend sondern im Gegenteil resourcen-intensiv sei, da die Daten stets auf Fehler und T{\"a}uschung gepr{\"u}ft werden m{\"u}ssten. Parsell argumentiert dagegen und bringt zwei Positionen vor: zum einen seien konnektionistische Modelle kontextsensitiv und damit mit geringem Aufwand vor solchen Defekten zu sch{\"u}tzen und zum anderen zeigen Ergebnisse der Erforschung von Vertrauensverh{\"a}ltnissen in sozialen Systemen, dass die {\"O}ffnung zum System hin nicht zwingend zu einer h{\"o}heren Eigenverwundbarkeit durch Fehler und T{\"a}uschung f{\"u}hren muss. === Details === Die Grundidee ist anscheinend die folgende: Mentale Zust{\"a}nde k{\"o}nnen sich auch {\"u}ber Individuen hinaus verbreiten. Um klarzustellen, welche Voraussetzungen es gibt, hat Clark 2005 entsprechend noch einen Katalog an Kriterien aufgestellt, die in nicht-biologischen Systemen zutreffen m{\"u}ssen. Clark 2005: "Mental States, including states of believing, could be grounded in physical traces that remain firmly outside the head" === Kommentar === Die Idee der "extended minds" von Clark und Chalmers klingt ganz spannend. Ich selbst habe deren Paper noch nicht gelesen. Die Idee erinnert mich ein wenig an die Frage der Evolution der Kultur analog zur Evolution der Organismen.},

Ten boys diagnosed with ADHD and ten normal control boys participated in the study. Groups did not significantly differ in mean age, grade level, ethnicity, or handedness. No participants reported simulator sickness following VR exposure. Children with ADHD exhibited more omission errors, commission errors, and overall body movement than normal control children in the VR classroom. Children with ADHD were more impacted by distraction in the VR classroom. VR classroom measures were correlated with traditional ADHD assessment tools and the flatscreen CPT. Of note, the small sample size incorporated in each group and higher WISC-III scores of normal controls might have some bearing on the overall interpretation of results. These data suggested that the Virtual Classroom had good potential for controlled performance assessment within an ecologically valid environment and appeared to parse out significant effects due to the presence of distraction stimuli.},

	abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Pixel Stream Editor. This forms the basis for an interactive synthesizer for designing highly realistic Computer Generated Imagery. The designer works in an interactive Very High Level programming environment which provides a very fast concept/implement/view iteration cycle.Naturalistic visual complexity is built up by composition of non-linear functions, as opposed to the more conventional texture mapping or growth model algorithms. Powerful primitives are included for creating controlled stochastic effects. We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of CGI.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal. The algorithms created with this paradigm are generally extremely fast, highly realistic, and asynchronously parallelizable at the pixel level. },

 illustrates its utilization inside a Virtual Reality (VR) platform for multimodal construction. The
 development of reusable and parameterizable routines which are based on the concept of
 Semantic Reflection is described. These routines work on the Knowledge Representation Layer
 (KRL) of a simulation framework to realize complex application logic and data flow concepts
 like field routing. The KRL is implemented by a functionally extended semantic network. The
 ST development in C++ preserves real-time capabilities while the abstract description of data
 structures and application logic realizes a persistent and platform-independent representation of
 programs. The advantages of traverser representation through Semantic Reflection are
 elaborated. Finally, an editing tool is presented that enables developers to visualize and modify
 the semantic networks which are used to describe the application.},

In this system the temporal and semantic relations intrinsic to referential utterances are expressed as a constraint satisfaction problem, where the propositional value of each referential unit during a multimodal dialogue updates incrementally the active set of constraints. As the system is based on findings of human cognition research it also regards, e.g., constraints implicitly assumed by human communicators. The implementation takes VR related real-time and immersive conditions into account and adapts its architecture to well known scene-graph based design patterns by introducing a so-called reference resolution engine. Regarding the conceptual work as well as regarding the implementation, special care has been taken to allow further refinements and modifications to the underlying resolving processes on a high level basis.},

	abstract = {Tracking user's visual attention is a fundamental aspect in novel human-computer interaction paradigms found in Virtual Reality. For example, multimodal interfaces or dialogue-based communications with virtual and real agents greatly benefit from the analysis of the user's visual attention as a vital source for deictic references or turn-taking signals. Current approaches to determine visual attention rely primarily on monocular eye trackers. Hence they are restricted to the interpretation of two-dimensional fixations relative to a defined area of projection. The study presented in this article compares precision, accuracy and application performance of two binocular eye tracking devices. Two algorithms are compared which derive depth information as required for visual attention-based 3D interfaces. This information is further applied to an improved VR selection task in which a binocular eye tracker and an adaptive neural network algorithm is used during the disambiguation of partly occluded objects.},

However, it almost always involves emotion: For example, it should engage, not inflict undesirable stress and frustration, and perhaps elicit positive emotions such as joy or delight. How would the system sense or recognize if it was succeeding in these elements of intelligent interaction? This keynote talk will address some ways that our work at the MIT Media Lab has advanced solutions for recognizing user emotion during everyday experiences.},

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	abstract = {Most computer graphics pictures have been computed all at once, so that the rendering program takes care of all computations relating to the overlap of objects. There are several applications, however, where elements must be rendered separately, relying on compositing techniques for the anti-aliased accumulation of the full image. This paper presents the case for four-channel pictures, demonstrating that a matte component can be computed similarly to the color channels. The paper discusses guidelines for the generation of elements and the arithmetic for their arbitrary compositing.},

If you've ever noticed dark edges around DXT1 alpha textures, you may want to brush up on this. Ever had to fill in color values even though the alpha was zero, because it somehow filtered through?

	abstract = {Virtual reality offers a new frontier for human interaction with simulation models. A virtual environment, such as that created with a CAVE, imposes either real-time or quasi-real-time performance on the simulation model. Beyond that general requirement, what others can be identified for simulation programs that drive a virtual reality or virtual environment interface? Based on experience with the Virginia Tech CAVE augmented by a literature search, we propose three key requirements for successful CAVE-based simulations: (1) Portability among CAVE-specific input/output devices, (2) effective and efficient interprocess communication, and (3) overcoming the limitations associated with input/output device interaction. Each requirement is described in some detail to both explain and justify its inclusion. Limitations and near- and intermediate-term research needs are identified.},

	abstract = {Detail enhances the visual richness and realism of computer-generated images. Our stochastic modelling approach, called particle systems, builds complex pictures from sets of simple, volume-filling primitives. For example, structured particle systems have been used to generate trees and a grass-covered forest floor. Particle systems can produce so much irregular, three-dimensional detail that exact shading and visible surface calculations become infeasible. We describe approximate and probabilistic algorithms for shading and the visible surface problem. Because particle systems algorithms generate richly-detailed images, it is hard to detect any deviation from an exact rendering. Recent work in stochastic modelling also enables us to model complex motions with random variation, such as a field of grass blowing in the breeze. We analyze the performance of our current algorithms to understand the costs of our stochastic modelling approach. },

components and their evaluation is achieved using a pattern oriented

an implicit parallelization using OpenMP. Both methods are then evaluated
and compared to each other for different traversal heuristics.},

In this paper we present a generic multimodal interface system where the user interacts with an anthropomorphic personalized interface agent using speech and natural gestures. The knowledge-based and uniform approach of SmartKom enables us to realize a comprehensive system that understands imprecise, ambiguous, or incomplete multimodal input and generates coordinated, cohesive, and coherent multimodal presentations for three scenarios, currently addressing more than 50 different functionalities of 14 applications. We demonstrate the main ideas in a walk through the main processing steps from modality fusion to modality fission.},

	abstract = {Rather than relying on costly physical mock-ups of functional assessment and rehabilitation environments, VR offers the option to produce and distribute identical "standard" environments. Within such digital assessment and rehabilitation scenarios, normative data can be accumulated for performance comparisons needed for assessment, diagnosis and for training purposes. As well, in this manner, reusable archetypic virtual environments constructed for one purpose, could also be applied for clinical applications addressing other purposes. This has now been done with the Virtual Classroom scenario. While originally developed as a controlled stimulus environment in which attention processes could be systematically assessed in children while in the presence of varying levels of distraction, the system is now finding use for other clinical targets. Such applications that are being developed and tested using the Virtual Classroom for other purposes include: 1. Expansion of the range of attention assessment tests (i.e., a \_Stroop` Interference testing system for all ages). 2. A wide field of view system to study eye tracking under distracting conditions with ADHD children using an Elumens VisionStation{\~A}‚{\^A}{\textregistered}. 3. Development of the Virtual Classroom as a tool for anxiety assessment and graduated exposure therapy for children with Social Anxiety Disorder. 4. An extension to the class to include a maze of halls leading out of the school for an earthquake safety training application with persons with developmental and learning disabilities.},

	annote = {VRML is a file format for the description of dynamic scene graphs
 containing 3D objects with their visual appearance, multimedia content, an event
 model, and scripting capabilities. It is designed to be used on the Internet and
 on local system and to be used as an exchange file format. Although equipped with
 sophisticated techniques for user interaction the current VRML standard still
 lacks direct support for sharing virtual worlds that can not only be visited but
 also manipulated by multiple users distributed over the network. Several
 multi-user technologies have been developed in the past and some use VRML as the
 rendering and interaction vehicle.\\This paper gives a short review of design
 considerations for distributed virtual environments and approaches taken so far
 in the development of multi-user technologies. We present the design and
 implementation of VIRTUS, a multi-user platform that allows multiple
 geographically separated users to enter and manipulate shared VRML scenes. },

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

The master process of an MR Toolkit application can transmit device data to other remote applications, and receive device data from remote applications. Application-specific data can also be shared between independent applications. Nominally, any number of peers may communicate together in order to run a multiprocessing application, and peers can join or leave the collaborative application at any time. The Peer Package is introduced and the theory of its operation is explained. The authors' experience with a demonstration program which they have written, called multi-player handball, that uses the Peer Package is discussed},

@article{slater:2009c,
	abstract = {In this paper, I address the question as to why participants tend to respond realistically to situations and events portrayed within an immersive virtual reality system. The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is 'being there', often called 'presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not 'there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.},

Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

Adults and children readily construct action representations organized with respect to an ultimate goal. These representations allow one to predict the consequences of action, interpret and describe actions, and categorize action sequences. In this paper, we explore the ontogeny of hierarchically organized action representations, and its relation to infants' ability to produce similar sequences. To do so, we examine infants' perception and performance of a means-end sequence: pulling a cloth to retrieve a toy. Using a visual habituation paradigm, we demonstrate that 12-month-old infants understand that the initial step of the cloth-pulling sequence is directed toward the ultimate goal of attaining the toy, and use their knowledge of the causal constraints of the sequence to make this goal attribution. Ten-month-olds, however, appear transitional with respect to this understanding: their ability to identify the goal of the cloth-pulling sequence is related to their own ability to planfully solve a similar sequence. These findings are consistent with a burgeoning body of literature suggesting an intimate link between action production and perception, and suggest that this link is in place by at least 10 months of age.},

	annote = {Michael Soto et al.: A Semantic Approach of Virtual Worlds Interoperability Abstract: In dem Zusammenwirken vers. virtuellen Umgebungen soll den auftretenden Problemen begegnet werden. Die Bedeutung von virtuellen Entit{\"a}ten in einer spez. VE wird duch ein Influence/Reaction Modell beschrieben, um die Beschreibung der Aktion klar zu trennen von den Konsequenzen der Aktion. In Erweiterung dazu soll zur Grundlegung gemeinsamen Wissens der Austausch und das Herleiten von Bedeutungen {\"u}ber den Abgleich durch Ontologien erm{\"o}glicht werden. 1. Introduction Verteilte VE k{\"o}nnen in allen Bereichen Verwendung finden => werden in Zukunft vielfach zum Einsatz kommen. Bisher sind dabei VE abgeschlossen in dem Sinne, dass User zweier verschiedener Umgebungen nicht zusammenarbeiten k{\"o}nnen. Als Anforderung f{\"u}r zuk{\"u}nftige VE entsteht aber gerade die M{\"o}glichkeit zur Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen VEs. Direkt dadurch wird die Frage der Heterogenit{\"a}t der Daten/ Umgebung aufgeworfen: Was bedeutet eine Aktion in einer VE in einer anderen VE unter anderen Gesichtspunkten (nicht als Klon der ersten, sondern gerade in VE, die sich auch durch ihr inneres Verhalten/ Erscheinungsbild unterscheiden) Wie l{\"a}sst sich ein Verhalten einer Entit{\"a}t auf eine solche andere VE {\"u}bertragen? > Die Semantik von abstrakteren Begriffen in der Ubertragung dann in einen Kontext hinein soll hier als L{\"o}sungsansatz vorgestellt werden. 2. Semantic in Virtual Worlds Semantik von VE ist auch von deren Zweck abh{\"a}ngig. Die Bedeutung einer Entit{\"a}t in einem speziellen VE ist auch abh{\"a}ngig von dessen Semantik (und Zweck). => Eine Entit{\"a}t kann verschiedenste Bedeutungen (Ubertragungen) haben in vers. VEs. > Die Semantik induziert das Verhalten eines Objektes. Auf zwei Punkte soll der Fokus hier gelegt werden: Beschreiben des Verhaltens: Influence/Reaction Modell Abgleich von Wissen (auch {\"u}ber Verhalten) {\"u}ber Ontologien > als high-level Konzept werden diese beiden Dinge unter dem Begriff Metaphor zusammengefasst. 3. The Influence/Reaction model Entit{\"a}ten sollen auserhalb ihres urspr{\"u}nglichen VE arbeiten k{\"o}nnen Daraus ergeben sich Konsequenzen: I. Das Ergebnis einer Aktion einer Entit{\"a}t ist nicht konstant sondern abh{\"a}ngig von der Umgebung (dem Kontext) und der Semantik der Entit{\"a}t. => Ergebnis der Aktion ist nicht Teil der Beschreibung der Aktion/ des Verhaltens Sondern: wird in der aktuellen VE direkt ausgef{\"u}hrt II. Die F{\"a}higkeiten/ Eigenschaften der Entit{\"a}t k{\"o}nnen in einer VE eingeschr{\"a}nkt sein. > Notwendig wird vor der Einbindung in eine Umgebung die Vorhersage der Kompatiblit{\"a}t => Angewendet wird das Influence/Reaction Modell: Definiert das Konzept der Aktion unter Trennung der Aktion von den Konsequenzen. 3.1. Die Regeln Zwei Arten von Regeln werden unterst{\"u}tzt: behavioral law - beschreiben das Verhalten einer Entit{\"a}t reaction law - geben die Ver{\"a}nderungen der Umgebung abh{\"a}ngig vom Kontext an (Grundregeln) => 2 Phasen in Aktionen: Einfl{\"u}sse auf Umgebung (Aktionen) und Reaktionen der Umgebung (s. Figure 1) Regeln bestehen aus Vorbedingungen ({\"u}ber dem Zustand der VE). Erweitert wird das Modell durch die Einf{\"u}hrung von resources. Diese repr{\"a}sentieren bedeutungstragende Eigenschaften der Umgebung (oder von Objekten oder Hintergundwissen). Resources k{\"o}nnen auch zur Konsistenzsicherung eingesetzt werden (Es gibt positive (= Existenz) und negative (=Verbot)). Der Ablauf (Fig. 1) im System ergibt sich: Aus Erf{\"u}llung von Vorbedingungen einer behavioral law werden Nachbedingungen produziert. > Deren Umsetzung in dem VE wird angeregt. => In Auswertung der Vorbedingungen der reaction laws werden nun auch die Nachbedingungen mit einbezogen und entsprechende Regeln angewendet > Nachbedingungen (versuchen VE zu modifizieren) 3.2. Example: Das hier eingef{\"u}hrte Beispiel wird in 3.3. und 5. fortgesetzt und verdeutlicht gut gerade den Einsatz von Ontologien zur Verbindung von VEs. 3.3. The Compatibility Evaluation Um das Zusammenarbeiten vers. VE erm{\"o}glichen zu k{\"o}nnen, m{\"u}ssen Entit{\"a}ten {\"u}berhaupt in beiden Umgebungen darstellbar sein = eine Semantik haben. Dieses wird durch die Kompatibili{\"a}t angegeben. Wird eine Entit{\"a}t in eine andere Umgebung {\"u}bertragen, wird ihr Grad der Kompatibilit{\"a}t {\"u}ber eine Funktion bestimmt abh{\"a}ngig von der Bedeutung der in den Regeln beteiligten Begriffe in der neuen virtuellen Umgebung. 4. Limitation of Influence/Reaction model Notwendig zur Ubertragung von Influence/Reaction Modellen auf verschiedene VEs ist ein Konsens {\"u}ber darin herrschende allgemeine Begriffe. > Ontologien sollen eingesetzt werden zum abstimmen der Begrifflichkeiten. 5. Enhancing virtual worlds interoperability with ontology Eine Ontologie soll eingesetzt werden als Vermittler zwischen den vers. VEs = dort wird der Begriffsvorrat definiert. Virtuelle Entit{\"a}ten werden mit semantic components assoziiert, die Angaben {\"u}ber Eigenschaften dieser angeben und Mapping-Regeln enthalten zwischen den Symbolen und den allgemeinen Konzepten in der Ontologie (s. Fig. 2: in den VE wird eine Entit{\"a}t auf der einen Seite konkret auch durch Werte beschrieben (ABox) - andererseits mit konzeptuellen Wissen des VE assoziiert (TBox). Dieses stellt ein Mapping auf allgemeine Defintion in der Ontologie bereit.). 6. Implementation 7. Conclusion and Further Works },

	abstract = {This paper presents a technical approach for temporal symbol integration aimed to be generally applicable in unimodal and multimodal user interfaces. It draws its strength from symbolic data representation and an underlying rulebased system, and is embedded in a multi-agent system. The core method for temporal integration is motivated by findings from cognitive science research. We discuss its application for a gesture recognition task and speech-gesture integration in a Virtual Construction scenario. Finally an outlook of an empirical evaluation is given.},

This abstraction, handling 3D point-based gesticulative interaction with modeled object hierarchies, is suitable for both virtual reality environments and traditional environments. Based on the VPA, an environment of virtual panels is demonstrated which can be incorporated into keyboard-and-mouse-based computing. Users are able to turn virtual knobs, adjust virtual sliders, and point at virtual screens on these virtual panels in this environment},

	abstract = {This paper describes the EVI3d framework, a distributed architecture developed to enhance interactions within Virtual Environments (VE). This framework manages many multi-sensorial devices such as trackers, data gloves, and speech or gesture recognition systems as well as haptic devices. The structure of this architecture allows a complete dispatching of device services and their clients on as many machines as required. With the dated events provided by its time synchronization system, it becomes possible to design a specific module to manage multimodal fusion processes. To this end, we describe how the EVI3d framework manages not only low-level events but also abstract modalities. Moreover, the data flow service of the EVI3d framework solves the problem of sharing the virtual scene between modality modules.},

@article{Turner:1996:HSV,
	annote = {In this paper, we demonstrate how a new interactive 3D desktop metaphor based on two-handed 3D direct manipulation registered with head-tracked stereo viewing can be applied to the task of constructing animated characters. In our configuration, a six degree-of-freedom head-tracker and CrystalEyes shutter glasses are used to produce stereo images that dynamically follow the user head motion. 3D virtual objects can be made to appear at a fixed location in physical space which the user may view from different angles by moving his head. To construct 3D animated characters, the user interacts with the simulated environment using both hands simultaneously: the left hand, controlling a Spaceball, is used for 3D navigation and object movement, while the right hand, holding a 3D mouse, is used to manipulate through a virtual tool metaphor the objects appearing in front of the screen. In this way, both incremental and absolute interactive input techniques are provided by the system. Hand-eye coordination is made possible by registering virtual space exactly to physical space, allowing a variety of complex 3D tasks necessary for constructing 3D animated characters to be performed more easily and more rapidly than is possible using traditional interactive techniques. The system has been tested using both Polhemus Fastrak and Logitech ultrasonic input devices for tracking the head and 3D mouse. Proceedings of Eurographics '96.},

The agent is part of an agent framework, which means that it can communicate with other agents. Its navigation task consists of guiding the visitors in the environment and to answer questions about this environment (a theatre building). Visitors are invited to explore this building, see what is there, ask questions and get advice from the navigation agent. A 2D map has been added to the environment so that visitors can make references to the locations and objects on this map, both in natural language and by clicking with the mouse, making it a multimodal system with cross-modality references.},

	abstract = {Current VRML browser implementations lack the flexibility of adaptable user interfaces and navigation modes, in massive contradiction to the primary motivation for using 3D, namely to give the user a more natural understanding of how to interact with computer systems and, in return, to make computer work more time-efficient. Multimodal interaction, such as the use of gesture and speech recognition, promises further improvement of the usability of 3D applications but can only be seen in dedicated applications thus far. We present a user interface framework including the definition of a node set and the interfaces to other devices: As a key feature, we propose a DeviceSensor node that allows grabbing arbitrary user input, and a Camera node to realize arbitrary navigation modes. The interface is based on the abstract formalism of a context-free grammar providing the representation of domain- and device-independent multimodal information contents. By changing the grammer the behaviour of the system can easily be modified.},

	abstract = {In the VIENA Project ("Virtual Environments and Agents") we develop easy-to-use virtual environments for interactive design and exploration. We have modeled and implemented a synthetic human-like agent, Hamilton, that inhabits a simulated office environment and acts as an embodied virtual interface agent (VIA). To explore or change the simulated environment, people can instruct Hamilton by way of verbal input and simple hand gestures. Hamilton has a variety of functionalities which are put in effect by its agency, a multi-agent system. In mediating an instruction, invisible agents track exact object locations and colorings, and they negotiate alternative ways of acting. Hamilton's agency is also able to adapt to individual users' preferences during run time. As the VIA is present in the synthetic scene, users can take advantage of its anthropomorphic features, and they can choose to communicate with the agent from an external or an immersed view.},

	abstract = {Virtuelle Realit{\"a}t oder Virtual Reality (VR) bezeichnet ein neuartiges Kommunikationsmedium, das die
 unmittelbare Wechselwirkung des Menschen mit r{\"a}umlich organisierten rechnergenerierten Darstellungen
 erlaubt. Verbunden mit k{\"o}rperlich verankerter Interaktion finden insbesondere gestische Eingaben starkes
 Interesse. Dieser Beitrag gibt einen {\"U}berblick {\"u}ber Forschungsarbeiten im Labor f{\"u}r K{\"u}nstliche Intelligenz
 und Virtuelle Realit{\"a}t an der Universit{\"a}t Bielefeld, mit denen Grundlagen f{\"u}r den Einsatz gestischer und
 sprachlicher Interaktionstechniken entwickelt werden; als Erprobungsdom{\"a}ne dient ein Szenario des virtuellen
 Konstruierens. F{\"u}r die schnelle Erfassung komplexer Hand-Armgesten werden derzeit Datenhandschuhe und
 K{\"o}rper-Tracker eingesetzt. Die Auswertung erfolgt mit wissensbasierten Ans{\"a}tzen, die atomare Formelemente
 der Gestik symbolisch beschreiben und zu gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Einheiten zusammensetzen. Ein zweites Thema ist die
 multimodale Interaktion durch sprachlich-gestische Eingaben, z.B. wenn auf einen Gegenstand gezeigt
 ("dieses Rohr") oder eine Drehrichtung ("so herum") signalisiert wird. Schlie{\ss}lich wird dargestellt, wie die
 Ans{\"a}tze zur Formbeschreibung von Gesten f{\"u}r die Synthese nat{\"u}rlich wirkender gestischer Ausgaben mit
 einer artikulierten, anthropomorphen Figur {\"u}bertragen werden k{\"o}nnen, die in laufenden Arbeiten mit
 Sprachausgaben koordiniert werden.},

	abstract = {The third edition of this book continues to focus on the 3D aspects of computer graphics, and reflects the growing demand for real-time applications such as games and virtual reality. It also includes new material on Visualization in Scientific Computing and graphics standards such as PHIGS. It deals with the processes involved in converting a mathematical or geometric description of an object - a computer graphics model - into a visualization - a two-dimensional projection - that simulates the appearance of a real object. Alan Watt provides students with a knowledge of complex and emerging topics in the field of computer graphics, including advances in rendering and new material on animation.

 Features
 NEW!Chapter on Advanced Radiosity.
 NEW! Chapter on Pre- Calculation Techniques.
 NEW! Material about real-time applications for high complexity such as progressive mesh optimization, BSP tree, pre-calculation techniques, and photo modelling techniques.
 Enhanced coverage of advances in rendering.
 Complete revision of material on animation.
 Includes a CD-ROM with a 400-image study and several computer graphic programs.},

@article{210080,
	abstract = {This article presents research?an experiment and the resulting prototype?on a method for treating gestural input so that it can be used for multimodal applications, such as interacting with virtual environments. This method involves the capture and use of natural , empty-hand gestures that are made during conventional descriptive utterances. Users are allowed to gesture in a normal continuous manner, rather than being restricted to a small set of discrete gestural commands as in most other systems. The gestures are captured and analyzed into a higher-level description. This description can be used by an application-specific interpreter to understand the gestural input in its proper context. Having a gesture analyzer of this sort enables natural gesture input to any appropriate application.},

Much of this revenue was generated by blockbuster titles created by large groups of people. Though large development teams are not unheard of in the software industry, game studios tend to have unique collections of developers. Software engineers make up a relatively small portion of the game development team, while the majority of the team consists of content creators such as artists, musicians, and designers.},

The core idea utilizes a semantic description of interfaces and component interplay in the area of Intelligent Real-time Interactive Systems IRIS. Semantic descriptions are encoded as OWL-based models, which build a Knowledge Representation Layer KRL of relevant interface constructs and component features. These models are automatically transformed into programming language code of a given target language. The result of that transformation forms a semantically grounded database of relevant system aspects that programmers can use to develop their application. Examples, taken from an application that was developed with the Simulator X framework, illustrate the different aspects of the proposed method and demonstrate its practicability.},

	abstract = { The mapping of images onto surfaces may substantially increase the realism and information content of computer-generated imagery. The projection of a flat source image onto a curved surface may involve sampling difficulties, however, which are compounded as the view of the surface changes. As the projected scale of the surface increases, interpolation between the original samples of the source image is necessary; as the scale is reduced, approximation of multiple samples in the source is required. Thus a constantly changing sampling window of view-dependent shape must traverse the source image. To reduce the computation implied by these requirements, a set of prefiltered source images may be created. This approach can be applied to particular advantage in animation, where a large number of frames using the same source image must be generated. This paper advances a ``pyramidal parametric'' prefiltering and sampling geometry which minimizes aliasing effects and assures continuity within and between target images. Although the mapping of texture onto surfaces is an excellent example of the process and provided the original motivation for its development, pyramidal parametric data structures admit of wider application. The aliasing of not only surface texture, but also highlights and even the surface representations themselves, may be minimized by pyramidal parametric means. },

	abstract = {Shadowing has historically been used to increase the intelligibility of scenes in electron microscopy and aerial survey. Various methods have been published for the determination of shadows in computer synthesized scenes. The display of shadows may make the shape and relative position of objects in such scenes more comprehensible; it is a technique lending vividness and realism to computer animation. To date, algorithms for the determination of shadows have been restricted to scenes constructed of planar polygons. A simple algorithm is described which utilizes Z-buffer visible surface computation to display shadows cast by objects modelled of smooth surface patches. The method can be applied to all environments, in fact, for which visible surfaces can be computed. The cost of determining the shadows associated with each light source is roughly twice the cost of rendering the scene without shadows, plus a fixed transformation overhead which depends on the image resolution. No extra entities are added to the scene description in the shadowing process. This comprehensive algorithm, which permits curved shadows to be cast on curved surfaces, is contrasted with a less costly method for casting the shadows of the environment on a single ground plane. In order to attain good results, the discrete nature of the visible-surface computations must be treated with care. The effects of dither, interpolation, and geometric quantization at different stages of the shadowing algorithm are examined. The special problems posed by self-shadowing surfaces are described.},

	abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multimodal gesture and speech driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR-applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of crossmodal temporal and semantic coherences, a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph-based) representation and into the dynamic (renderloop and immersion) aspects of a realtime application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multimodal and scenecontext related evaluation procedures for VR-setups.
 As an example for the concepts, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described.},

	annote = {Bob Zeleznik, et al: Scene-Graph-As-Bus: Collaboration between Hetereogeneous Stand-Alone 3-D Graphical Applications Eurographics 2000, Volume 19 1. Introduction Ziel ist die Schaffung einer Software, die es erm{\"o}glicht schnell virtuelle Umgebungen in verschiedensten Laufzeitumgebungen zu realisieren, die damit unabh{\"a}ngig von speziellen Rendering Engines ist. Die meisten aktuellen Systeme k{\"o}nnen nur im Zusammenhang mit ihren spezifischen umgebenden Systemen (f{\"u}r Rendering und Eingabe) zum Einsatz kommen. Das vorgestellte System soll zum einen ein abstraktes verteiltes High-Level Format zur Verf{\"u}gung stellen, {\"u}ber das aus verschiedensten anderen Systemen zugegriffen werden kann und gleichzeitig dabei einen m{\"o}glichst grosen Freiheitsgrad bieten. Das angestrebte System soll in verschiedenen Stufen eingef{\"u}hrt werden. 2. Overview Grundvoraussetzung der anschliessbaren Systeme: Szenengraph als zentrale Struktur mit monitoring (= Benachrichtigung bei Anderungen, {\"u}ber Callbacks) Der Szenengraph wird verteilt {\"u}ber den Scene-Graph-As-Bus Ansatz: Der konkrete SG eines Systems > wird umgesetzt in einen NSG (neutralen SG) > dieser wird verteilt. Anderungen in einem SG werden {\"u}berf{\"u}hrt auf die abstrakte Schicht des NSG und von da verteilt. Zwei Einsatzm{\"o}glichkeiten des Systems: Netzwerkeinsatz eines VE erstellen hybrider Systeme aus einzelnen Komponenten 3. Prior Work Verteilte Systeme: Two, SPLINE, NPSNET, Im Gegensatz zu SGAB: SGAB nimmt keine (oder m{\"o}glichst wenig) Anderungen an beteiligten Systemen vor. Systeme f{\"u}r Hybride Anwendungen: CORBA, Avango, Unterschied: SGAB bietet Replikation der Datenhaltung f{\"u}r verschiedenste Graphikanwendungen. 4. SGAB Theory and Design SGAB besteht aus mehreren Ebenen (Fig. 1). Zwischen diesen Ebenen findet jeweils ein Mapping statt eine Abbildung von Strukturen: Zuerst ist dort der konkrete SG eines speziellen Systems. Dieses wird auf einen NSG gemappt. Es wird eine Abbildungsvorschrift ben{\"o}tigt, um die vers. Strukturen aufeinander abzubilden und sp{\"a}ter auch Anderungen zwischen diesen vorzunehmen: t.w. sind dieses einfache direkte Beziehungen, es k{\"o}nnen aber auch Beziehungen sein, die Teilgraphen mit einem Knoten oder Attribut abgleichen sollen. Auch Callbacks und Funktionen werden durch den Mapping Layer zur Verf{\"u}gung gestellt. Der NSG wird {\"u}ber die Network Bridge {\"u}ber das Netzwerk verteilt und der Zugriff auf bestimmte teile des SG geregelt. 5. SGAB Implementation Die Implementation schl{\"a}gt vor allem zwei Br{\"u}cken: Das Mapping von SG zu NSG die vermittelnten Daten k{\"o}nnen nat{\"u}rlich nichts {\"u}ber die Beschaffenheit der Mappingfunktionen wissen, aber spezielle events k{\"o}nnen aufgerufen werden (bei Erzeugung, Anderung, ) Die Verteilung und Zugriffsregelung im Netzwerk {\"u}ber die Network Bridge (Fig. 2). Der NSG stellt einen vereinfachten abstrakten SG dar ohne Rendering-F{\"a}higkeiten. Er besteht aus Knoten, die einen Namen haben (Dieser dient auch zur Bestimmung der Semantik des Knotens!) und Felder (plus einige FLags, die das verhalten des Knotens beschreiben k{\"o}nnen), sowie einen Hinweis auf seinen Erzeuger. Beispielhafte Implementierungen von Anbindungen an konkrete SG-Tools sind durchgef{\"u}hrt worden: Einfach war die Anbindung an OpenInventor (direktes Mapping). Die Anbindung an Jot erforderte tw. ein komplizierteres Mapping von Strukturen auf Attribute. Im hybriden Betrieb beider Systeme liessen sich aber gut deren F{\"a}higkeiten kombinieren (s. Fig. 4 und 5: einige spez. physikal. Verhaltensweisen aus Jot werden mit in OpenInventor visualisiert). In der Netzwerkimplementierung wurden auch zwei Varianten implementiert: eine peer-to-peer und eine Client-Server. 7. Conclusions and Future Work SGAB f{\"u}r allgemeine SG zum Abgleich von Daten und Strukturen. Notw.: Reporting! dieses nicht in OpenPerformer => erweitern davon, Mapping Layer {\"u}bernimmt reproting oder ein dauerndes Polling von Belegungen wenn Anbindung erfolgen soll. Noch wird nicht die Verteilugn und Vorhaltung higher-level Semantik unterst{\"u}tzt. Dieses k{\"o}nnte eine m{\"o}gliche Erweiterung sein die Hinterlegung mit zus{\"a}tzlichem semantischen Wissen},

@proceedings{latoschik:2008to,
	abstract = {Welcome to the first Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS). We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems‐related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.

 In previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work‐ mshop provides a face‐to‐face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems (RIS). Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real‐ time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa‐ rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state‐of‐the‐art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum‐ omarize the work our community is doing.

 Arranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:

 * Systems. Six development systems are presented (InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN)
 * Abstraction Is ‐ sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs.

	abstract = {Welcome to SEARIS 2010! We are delighted to rerun this workshop at IEEE VR in Waltham, Massachusetts for the third time, really making it an annual event. We hope this continues to be a place for discussing the state of the art on Software Engineering in our field.
Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Real-time Interac-tive Systems (RIS) in the past two decades. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real-time simulation and computer games led to manifold in-spiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and separate both, novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state-of-the-art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will al-low us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. The workshop series is an inte-grated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to summarize the work our community is doing. 
SEARIS provides a forum for researchers and practitioners working on the design, de-velopment, and support of real-time interactive systems which span from VR, AR, and MR environments to novel Human-Computer-Interaction systems and entertainment applications. After successful SEARIS workshops in 2008 and 2009, the follow-up pro-ceeds to establish a sustainable community shaping a common understanding, deriving common paradigms, developing useful and necessary methods and techniques, and fos-tering new ideas. 
This year's proceedings contain 14 accepted contributions, which add to the ideas and discussions of the community from the past SEARIS Workshop's in 2008 and 2009. All contributions are also available online (http://www.searis.net).
Various hot-topics have been identified from the current scientific discussion and have been presented and discussed in different sessions. The contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several key issues. We grouped the papers into four main sections: 

*Concepts, Methods and Techniques
*Frameworks & Specific Architectures
*Behavior & Dataflow
*Distribution

The target audience for the SEARIS workshop series and its publications are researchers and developers from VR/AR as well as from technically close fields like ambient or per-vasive computing and - of course - the computer games community. 
We would like to thank all people who made this workshop a reality. First, to the work-shop chairs at IEEE VR for their support and willingness to accept our proposal. Next, to all people who submitted papers to this track, either accepted or not. They are the heart and soul of this workshop and the starting point to the discussion we would like to fos-ter. Finally, we also like to thank the attendees of the workshop for their active interest in this research area.

This year's workshop at IEEE VR 2009 has built on our previous experiences at SEARIS 2008 and fostered an interactive, discussion‐like exchange format as opposed to rather traditional paper presentations.
We have been delighted to be again part of the program of IEEE VR 2009 in Lafayette, Louisiana. The proceedings contain 11 accepted contributions, which add on to the ideas and discussions the community has collected during the first SEARIS Workshop in 2008 and are also available online at http://www.searis.net/.
Various hot topics have been identified from the current scientific discussion and have been presented and discussed in different panels. The contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several key issues.

We grouped the papers into 4 main sections:
‐ Specific System Architectures ‐ Modeling and Abstraction ‐ Subsystems of RIS ‐ Methodology and Patterns

@proceedings{searis:2008,
	abstract = {Welcome to the first Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS). We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems‐related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.

 In previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work‐ mshop provides a face‐to‐face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems (RIS). Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real‐ time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa‐ rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state‐of‐the‐art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum‐ omarize the work our community is doing.

 Arranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:

 * Systems. Six development systems are presented (InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN)
 * Abstraction Is ‐ sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs.
 * Special Issues. In this section we collect papers related to the implementation of RIS in particular platforms, such as mobile systems, multi‐rate systems, and Mixed Reality.
 * Semantic and Dynamic Modeling. The four papers in this section show models for expli‐ citly describing semantic (i.e. "a chair is on the floor") and dynamic information.},
