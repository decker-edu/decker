# Non-draft Deck

This should be the only non-draft deck if `draft: true` is set in `decker.yaml`.

# Solution Slides

Slides marked with class `solution` are culled from the deck if the deck is
declared to be upcoming with `lecture.status: upcoming` in the meta data.

This deck:

-   `lecture.status:` [:meta](lecture.status)
-   `lecture.publish:` [:meta](lecture.publish)

If `lecture.status:` is `upcoming` and `lecture.publish:` is `yes` the next
slide should be missing

# Missing {.solution}

FUCK

# Solution Boxes

Boxes marked with class `solution` are culled from the slide if the deck is
declared to be upcoming with `lecture.status: upcoming` in the meta data.

This deck:

-   `lecture.status:` [:meta](lecture.status)
-   `lecture.publish:` [:meta](lecture.publish)

If `lecture.status:` is `upcoming` and `lecture.publish:` is `yes` the next box
should be missing

## Missing {.solution}

FUCK
